to podcasts on the excellent Twit.tv network and it goes without saying
<a href=http://www.twit.tv/floss>Floss Weekly</a> is one of my favourites. <a href=http://www.twit.tv/floss120>A
recent episode</a> covered
<a href=http://www.haiku-os.org/>Haiku</a> - an open source operating system
based on the design of the old BeOS. What&rsquo;s very interesting about
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS>BeOS</a> is the design, an integrated
all in one operating system - and the fact Apple almost purchased it.
That&rsquo;s amazing to me, literally in one fell swoop, if Apple had of
offered the 200 million Be Systems wanted, there would be no NextStep
into Apple and by extension - Steve Jobs. It&rsquo;s especially poignant since
Apple just surpassed Microsoft to become the second most valuable
American company.</p><p>The most spiritually similar of todays operating systems would be Mac OS
X, as it brings the integration BeOS was after. I&rsquo;ve only played with
Haiku in a virtual machine, but already I am impressed. It&rsquo;s a well
designed system, not as buggy as I expected - it&rsquo;s only on alpha2 after
years of development. There&rsquo;s already a lot of applications, all native
and therein lies the fault. The Web browser (not surprisingly) is the
buggiest of all the applications I tried. Most apps are small one
purpose apps, not hard to see a unixy philosophy. One of the developer&rsquo;s
mentioned a port of QT, which could bring QT based apps such as Skype,
KDE apps.</p><p><strong>Apps or Web?</strong><br>I think the biggest use of Haiku could be on net-books, it performed
extremely well in limited virtual machine - so it&rsquo;s a pity there&rsquo;s no
commercial sponsor to push it out. The developers mentioned a port of
Java or GTK is not on the radar, so you can kiss good-bye to any Gnome
or Java apps (Firefox, Chrome, OpenOffice.org), but they mentioned they
will target web apps. This seems very curious without a major web
browser, as anyone knows the web should be standards based but how often
have we seen &ldquo;Supports Chrome 3+ Firefox 3+ Safari 4+ IE7+&rdquo; so if this
is the agreed upon approach - they really need a major browser. As a
computer science person, the design of the system interests me the most,
vs others, but I haven&rsquo;t dug too deep yet, when I do, I&rsquo;ll be sure to
post.</p><p><strong>Hardware Support</strong><br>I haven&rsquo;t dug in to this either, but anecdotally a good guess would be
hardware support would be poor. The main hurdle and the majority of code
in Linux is purely based on the millions of hardware combinations
PC-based (X86) have to use. This is why for any traction for Haiku, I
think hardware support needs to be OEM based, possibly like the
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product>white-label</a> EEE PC
netbooks.</p><p>If you like trying different operating systems, have a copy of
VirtualBox or VMWare (and by extension a decently fast computer) give
Haiku a try!</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
