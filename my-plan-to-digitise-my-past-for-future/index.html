digitise as much photo, video and documents you can. It serves as a
record of your existance, a guide to people of what your life was like.
Why? is the most obvious question you might ask. Well I will tell you
what prompted me, which is the culmination of a lot of different
things.</p><p>This brings me to the first reason: Television. I find shows fascinating
where people discover their ancestors were orphans, incredibly wealthy
or died from exhaustion in a mine. It really makes you think what makes
you the person you are, so to speak. David Attenborough says (although I
have paraphrased) that if people look back at his 100-150 hours of
television, they will get a snapshot of what the glaciers, mountains,
desert and animals were like in the latter half of the twentieth
century, not a complete picture, but one nonetheless of what Earth was
like at that time.</p><p>If not for other people, do it for yourself is another reason. Memories
are their to cherish and recall. As I try to quantify the future I feel
that if I have any childeren, it will be incredibly weird they have been
missing a whole segment of my life. But no better time has existed to
preserve these memories, in an age where digital devices are commonplace
and cheap. They also are disposable though, so I will have to be careful
to keep my data in a medium that can be read, a challenge in itself. But
I believe I am up to it, and I hope to have every photo, video and
document I have in a digital format sometime in the near future.</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
