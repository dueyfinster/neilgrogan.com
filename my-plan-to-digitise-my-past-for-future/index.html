<h1 class="post-title">My Plan to Digitise my past, for the future</h1>
    
    <time>January 30, 2007</time>
    

    <div>
        
        <p>
        <p>I am embarking on a journey I believe everyone should: digitise as much photo,
video and documents you can. It serves as a record of your existance, a guide to
people of what your life was like. Why? is the most obvious question you might
ask. Well I will tell you what prompted me, which is the culmination of a lot of
different things.</p>
<p>This brings me to the first reason: Television. I find shows fascinating where
people discover their ancestors were orphans, incredibly wealthy or died from
exhaustion in a mine. It really makes you think what makes you the person you
are, so to speak. David Attenborough says (although I have paraphrased) that if
people look back at his 100-150 hours of television, they will get a snapshot of
what the glaciers, mountains, desert and animals were like in the latter half of
the twentieth century, not a complete picture, but one nonetheless of what Earth
was like at that time.</p>
<p>If not for other people, do it for yourself is another reason. Memories are
their to cherish and recall. As I try to quantify the future I feel that if I
have any childeren, it will be incredibly weird they have been missing a whole
segment of my life. But no better time has existed to preserve these memories,
in an age where digital devices are commonplace and cheap. They also are
disposable though, so I will have to be careful to keep my data in a medium that
can be read, a challenge in itself. But I believe I am up to it, and I hope to
have every photo, video and document I have in a digital format sometime in the
near future.</p>
