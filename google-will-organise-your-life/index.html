Worlds Information”. While it is what you expect from Google, the Calendar did
not impress me a whole lot. It does have an intuitive interface, that is easy
to use. It does integrate with Gmail, although the full extent has yet to be
seen, as they fall short of mentioning it in Gmail at all, but I would expect
this to change. I see great potential for users though, and where Google is
heading. They will eventually integrate it with GoogleTalk and Gmail,
producing a hybrid interface where you can organise a conference on
GoogleTalk, schedule it on your calendar (which is syncronised with your PC
and your workgroup server [therby informing fellow employees]), submit video
of it to Google Video, write minutes with writely, email minutes with Gmail,
that mail (with document and video) being attached to the meeting on the
Calendar, which is in turn archived on your PC in Google Desktop and your
Gmail Drive. While that is only one scenario, it is very possible. Google have
already leaked information on their eagerness to hold the entire contents of
ones&rsquo; hard drive on the internet.</p><p>This of course leads to privacy fears, will the U.S. or Chinese governments
have access to literally anything on your computer? The <a href=http://www.eff.org/>Electronic Frontier
Foundation</a> is an online rights advocacy group, and they recently
discouraged people from downloading the latest Google Desktop, due to the fact
it will backup your information online for 30 days. You can exclude folders
and files from Google Desktops index, but this is a manual process. So where
will the future lie, and how far will Google go to get the most relevent
results? Who knows, but one thing is for sure, with their increase in market
share at expense of MSN and Yahoo, Google is here to stay.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/google>#google</a></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><script src=../js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
