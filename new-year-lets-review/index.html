tell you what I am looking forward to in 2006. The year was firmly in the
hands of mother nature as we saw in both Pakistan, New Orleans/Gulf of Mexico
and the Tsunami’s after effects. International consensus was reached at the G8
as London was being bombed - not by the IRA, but by their new enemies in the
middle east. Iran esculated its pressure on the world by resuming its nuclear
activities. George W. Bush took office in January, much to the distaste of the
Daily Mirror in the UK, who scored their most famous headline, “How Could
59,054,087 People, Be So Dumb?”.</p><h2 id=good-year-for->Good Year For…</h2><ul><li>For Natural Disasters (Katrina, Earthquake)</li><li>George W.

hope some of the better things come true! It’s gonna be another great year for
technology and gadgets, with more MP3’s predicted to be sold in 2006 than ever
before, lets just hope Time Magazine doesn’t give iPod gadget of the century
this year!</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/politics>#politics</a></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
