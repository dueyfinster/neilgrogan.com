sell Ubuntu on their computers. With the Ubuntu Dells reportedly selling
very well and Dell rolling out the program worldwide, this hasn&rsquo;t
escaped the notice of the world&rsquo;s number one computer manufacturer - HP.
This is speculation from blogs that has been going on for months since
Dell started to offer Ubuntu. The Direct to Dell Blog states:</p><blockquote><p>This <a href=http://tomdryer.com/blog/index.php/2007/07/03/is-hp-going-to-start-offering-ubuntu/>recent post from Tom
Dryer</a>
caught my eye a couple of days ago, and thought I&rsquo;d comment on it
here. If the rumors about HP offering Ubuntu are true, we&rsquo;re glad to
see other vendors join us in support of Ubuntu and open source. We
welcome HP and other system vendors that want to join in this
initiative.</p></blockquote><p>This is very good news indeed and I am glad Dell is being very receptive
to the idea, they even made this humorous video about their new foray
into Open Source:</p><p><a href=http://www.ubuntuhomeserver.org/>Ubuntu Home Server</a> is a newly
announced project by Ubuntu community members to compete with <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx>Windows
Home
Server</a>.
Personally I think Microsoft is barking up the wrong tree with this, I
don&rsquo;t think many home users will bother with this type of product, maybe
it will take off in a couple of years, but most people are not
tech-savvy, and even if they are, chances are there already doing this
with Linux, Xbox360 or a PS3. Many people can&rsquo;t tell me even what a
server is, never mind what it can do. Also it won&rsquo;t make sense because
people expect to have everything on their pc ready to go, and to not
have to purchase another one to throw in a storage closet. Nevertheless
to paraphrase Bill Gates and Steve Jobs at D5 Conference: We Built
things we wanted to have. So in that tone and considering the Home
server product is just modified Windows (it would not cost as much as
say a whole new project like Zune or Xbox 360), I can see where
Microsoft is betting that this is one of many avenues in the future.
Personally I think it will be specialised hardware devices that will win
this space, like Intel VIIV, Apple TV or one of the many consoles I
mentioned.</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
