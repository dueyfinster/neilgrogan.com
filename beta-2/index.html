the new <a href=http://www.kde.org/>KDE</a> 4.2 beta 2. For those of you who
don&rsquo;t know; KDE is the <a href=http://www.kde.org/>K Desktop Environment</a>;
which includes a window manager
(<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwin>KWin</a>), common desktop
applications, its own menu
(<a href=http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html>Kickoff</a>),
browser (<a href=http://www.konqueror.org/>Konqueror</a>), file manager
(<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_(software)>dolphin</a>) etc.
Basically it is the most popular desktop environment on Linux next to
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME>Gnome</a>.</p><p><img src=http://kde.org/announcements/announce_4.2-beta1/desktop_thumb.png alt=image>
*KDE 4.2 Beta 2 with Kickoff Menu visible</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>**What is so special about KDE? **<br>The philosophy of KDE is the advanced configuration it allows through
its <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI>Graphical User Interface</a> (GUI),
this is versus <a href=http://www.gnome.org/>Gnome</a> which chooses sane
defaults and leaves configuration in hard to reach places and
out-of-sight. This isn&rsquo;t to say KDE doesn&rsquo;t choose sane defaults; it
does and is very user-friendly. KDE has always been the more
Windows-like of the major desktop environments and this hasn&rsquo;t really
changed in KDE 4.X series. KDE is available in popular distributions of
Linux such as Kubuntu, <a href=http://www.mandriva.com/>Mandriva</a>,
<a href=http://www.opensuse.org/en/>OpenSuse</a>. The special part about 4.X
series is that for the first time for any Linux desktop environment; it
is fully cross-platform, easily installs and works on Microsoft Windows
and Apple Mac OS X.</p><p><a href=http://kde.org/announcements/announce_4.2-beta2/panel.png><img src=http://kde.org/announcements/announce_4.2-beta2/panel_thumb.png alt=image></a>
<em>KDE 4.2 Panel; with KOrganizer calendar open</em></p><p><strong>Whats new in 4.2?</strong><br><strong>Stability</strong>. Ever since KDE started the really beautiful 4.X branch
they have gotten harsh criticism for stability problems. This is not
surprising as KDE 3.5 was the result of years of bugfixing and stability
fixes and was really rock solid stable; in fact I don&rsquo;t remember it
crashing at all in the times I used it; but I have been a Gnome user for
a while. This criticism was deserved; but perhaps premature: KDE always
stated this almost ground-up rewrite of everything major wasn&rsquo;t going to
be pretty and it wasn&rsquo;t. I used KDE 4.0 and KDE 4.1 and both crashed
frequently; especially Plasma since it powers almost everything on the
desktop.</p><p><em>Desktop Effects</em><br>With this release comes the introduction of desktop effects; if your
graphics card is supported. I think this is a great move since projects
like Compiz required hacked in dectection of KDE or Gnome and I suspect
this was coded in; it really makes sense to have desktop effects in the
core; as it will really help stabilise them as the KDE4.X branch
matures.<br>*<br>*<br><em>Better Customisation</em><br>You can now control height and length of the menu bar; as well as add
many more plasma applets to it. The Kmenu replacement Kickoff has
stepped up to the plate in this release and features almost a complete
set of icons for any application (much to my chargrin in earlier release
a lot of ? icons could be seen). Also more customisation and preference
panes of Plasmoids are allowed.</p><p><a href=http://kde.org/announcements/announce_4.2-beta2/improved-desktop-grid.png><img src=http://kde.org/announcements/announce_4.2-beta2/improved-desktop-grid_thumb.png alt=image></a>
<em>Desktop Effects in KDE 4.2 Beta 2</em></p><p><a href=http://kde.org/announcements/announce-4.2-beta2.php>Full major feature overview is
here.</a></p><p><em>So whats the final assessment?</em><br>When this is released I definately recommend you try it! This is the
first release of the 4.X branch I would be happy to install and support
on my family&rsquo;s desktop. Since I don&rsquo;t often get to access it physically
to fix problems; this is one area I couldn&rsquo;t trust either 4.0 or 4.1 to
behave. It still isn&rsquo;t as feature-completed or as stable as 3.5 series;
but in my opinion it is damn close and approaching fast; get it while
its hot!!</p><p><a href=http://www.kubuntu.org/news/kde-4.2-beta-2>Kubuntu Instructions to get KDE 4.2 Beta 2 on Kubuntu Intrepid
