am not a big gamer; I primarily love systems and how they work. I do own
a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3>PS3</a> (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_hardware>amazing
hardware</a> I might
add) and I prefer
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter>FPS</a> and generally
devious natured video games (like the
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)>GTA</a>
franchise). Does that make me a bad person who wants to kill people? Of
course not; nothing could be further from the truth. But some people
stick their fingers in their ears and shout &ldquo;LA LA LA
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre>Columbine</a>
LALALA Terrorists LALALA Violent Video Games!". They say it is
destructive to childrens young precious minds. The &ldquo;<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_The_Children_(politics)>Think of The
Children</a>&rdquo;
argument always disgusted me; its like shouting Fire in a packed room
when their is no danger: it is false, just to garner attention and a
sickening twisted version of the facts. Are violent video games harmful
to kids? <em>Probably</em>; I wouldn&rsquo;t advocate giving them access since they;
just like movies are <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_European_Game_Information><strong>clearly rated for
Adults</strong></a>. *</p><ul><li></li></ul><p><a href=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Codbox.jpg><img src=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Codbox.jpg alt=image></a><em>What
is so hard to understand about that?</em> Its is clearly an issue of
parenting and morals whether you allow your child access to such
material. So it is clear the real issue is the lack of proper guidance
by parents; either to not bother enforcing the ratings, block their
children from receiving them as gifts, or monitor to check if they spend
pocket money on such items. They gladly do so for other adult items like
adult content, movies, cigarettes and alcohol; why not video games?
Today&rsquo;s consoles even have ratings built-in (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360) which
are enforceable by a password the parent can set. This makes it a breeze
to block adult games and really hard for the average child (never mind
adult) to circumvent. They could still play it at a friends house of
course; you can&rsquo;t lock your children down, but even so you can actively
limit their exposure to such material. The study points out what others
and I have always known: Video games don&rsquo;t corrupt a mind by themselves,
other factors (mainly social/upbringing) have a much bigger impact
(Highlighting mine for brevity):</p><blockquote><p>Research at Smith & Jones seems to imply that feelings of anger and
powerlessness often pre-exist a compulsion to play violent games. In
some cases these people find each other in the gaming world and form a
bond based on those feelings of alienation and anger.<br>Mr Bakker believes that if there was more <strong>commitment from parents
and other care givers</strong> to listen to what their children are saying
then these issues of isolation and frustration could be dealt with at
source and bring many young people out of the virtual world and back
into real life.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I continue to call gaming an addiction it takes away the element
of choice these people have,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a complete shift in my
thinking and also a shift in the thinking of my clinic and the way it
treats these people.&rdquo;<br>Mr Bakker sees a time when addiction centres like Smith & Jones could
close down if parents and <strong>adults in the community took more
responsibility for the habits of their children</strong>.
&ldquo;In most cases of compulsive gaming, it is not addiction and in that
case, <strong>the solution lies elsewhere</strong>.&rdquo; - <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7746471.stm>Courtesy BBC
