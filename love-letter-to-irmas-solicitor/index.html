<h1 class="post-title">Love letter to IRMA&#39;s Solicitor</h1>
    
    <time>March 7, 2009</time>
    

    <div>
        
        <p>
        <ul>
<li>
<p>This post is a continuation on the previous one. IRMA is the Irish Music
Rights Organisation which represents the big four record companies and their
bottom line: never the artist. They have recently tried to regulate the
Internet and have forced the biggest Irish ISP: Eircom; to use the three
strikes rule and boot people off the Internet&hellip; No Judge, no Jury, no
evidence of a crime.. Just an IP address and a sanction which you cannot
contest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have sent a poignant email to IRMA&rsquo;s solicitor based on their letter of
attack on the ISP&rsquo;s. If you think any of the language is too harsh by me;
<a href="http://blog.blacknight.com/images/irmaletter.pdf">please have a look at a sample of the threat letter this solicitor sent out here</a>.
This is a legal firm who were suing individuals for thousands of euro; which I
would hazard a guess most couldn&rsquo;t pay. So in my eyes this is a form of legal
terrorism; and a joke letter to give this solicitor a heads up that there are
people out there like me who read and know the tactics of the Irish Music
Rights Organisation; and the parent companies like IFPI, RIAA and the
Anit-Piracy Bureau they spring from&hellip;. It is my opinion that nothing short of
punishment (jail time) for frivolous threat letters should be carried out,
plus damages (x10 like they do in their cases) to individuals and companies
wrongly stressed out by this. I will compile a blog post of all the FUD (Fear,
Uncertainty and Doubt) that IRMA has spread soon; and a rebuttal of why their
actions may even increase piracy. One thing is for sure; my analysis will be a
whole lot cheaper (free) and probably more accurate!
<strong>Note:</strong> I have taken out names, but the legal firm and the acting solicitor
can be examined in the letter above ^</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear [Solicitor for IRMA&rsquo;s name],</p>
<p>It is my position that you are morally bankrupt through your actions via IRMA
vs. ISP&rsquo;s. If you need independent advice on how this technology works (I am
in Computer Science; but I can explain things slowly; so who knows?) I would
be most delighted to help. Please note my hourly rate is at least twice yours;
but I&rsquo;m worth it!</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you in 7 days; lest I contact a credit agency
for non-payment. As this email constitutes services rendered by me. But I am
willing to trade for legal advice on disbarment of a solicitors firm I know
which abuses the law; only because I am a reasonable person!</p>
<p>Kindest Regards &amp; Love,<br>
[My Footer]</p>
<p>PS: This is intended as Humour&hellip; only slightly&hellip;(joke!). I will publish any
response you make on the Internet; so keep this in mind; if you don&rsquo;t wish it
so; don&rsquo;t respond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rest assured I will publish any response; but I don&rsquo;t expect one&hellip;.</p>
