** Why blog with Org mode?
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and project
planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.
#+END_QUOTE

Like most things in the Emacs world, this description of [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] belies the
true depth of what it can do. Mostly I use Org mode only superficially as a way
to track notes and projects, using it as a tree of tasks and the status of each.
However, Org mode is good at many other tasks, not least of those is authoring
content. I write most of the posts in this blog using markdown, but since I am
in Emacs anyway and Org mode is a much richer authoring tool I decided to give
it a go.
