patent
infringement</a>.
This is all about multiple workspaces that can hold various graphical
user elements, a Xerox Parc patent which dates to the early 1990&rsquo;s.
Xerox Palo Alto Research center invented the graphical user interface in
the 1980&rsquo;s, only to been, licensed and used by Steve Jobs in Mac OS
Classic. Now IP Innovation, a submarine patent troll, who make no
products and bought the patent want their payday. The logical step is to
go after the biggest infringer to set a precedent for your patent, and
then make your way to all the smaller companies who infringe. Well
logically of course that would be Apple or Microsoft. Apple has already
paid them a reported 20 million dollars, and well no-one knows what
Microsoft has done, but this fish is smelly. From the Register
Article:</p><blockquote><p>The complaint, available
<a href=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IPvRH-1.pdf>here</a> as a pdf, says &ldquo;the Red
Hat Linux system, the Novell Suse Linux Enterprise Desktop and the
Novell Suse Linux Enterprise Server all breach held patents. The
companies seek increased damages for the willful infringements of
their patents and an injunction to prevent further infringements&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>So we already know they bought a patent thats years old, are patent
trolls, they extorted money from <a href=http://www.apple.com/>Apple</a> and
<a href=http://www.microsoft.com/>Microsoft</a> appears to have no dealings with
them. But wait! We see Steve Ballmer (Microsoft&rsquo;s CEO) saying recently
Linux should have to pay like Microsoft does in the &ldquo;IP Regime&rdquo;. Regime
always seemed a rather nasty word to me, something your forced to put up
with - like Robert Mugabes regime in Zimbabwe; come to think of it
Steve, I would have said that exact same thing - a dirty rotten evil
patent regime - but thats not what you meant. You meant you wanted a cut
for every Linux support contract and if its free like
<a href=http://www.ubuntu.com/>Ubuntu</a> - well though, you want money anyway.
Steve you claim innovation Microsoft produced is in Linux, but refuse to
show any evidence. Your bold statements which could be considered
illegal under Sarbanes-Oxley in the United States hasn&rsquo;t stopped you.
But a patent lawsuit has, you know it will destroy Microsoft and can
never kill Linux- maybe Linux business but you&rsquo;d settle for that (If we
can&rsquo;t make money off it, no one can!). Now we have a patent troll, and
Open Source legal resources <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071011205044141">Groklaw has exposed it to employ Microsoft
employees who specialise in
patents</a>. We
are well aware as a community you have a hand in this - how much remains
to be seen. The community warned you through the Open Invention network
( a patent clearinghouse which vows to protect open source through
pooled patents by Sony, HP, IBM, Google, Phillips, Novell, Oracle, Red
Hat and others) and <a href="http://digitaltippingpoint.com/wiki/index.php?title=Sue_me_first,_microsoft">a petition of thousands of people to put up or shut
up about
patents</a>.
Now you have released SCO II when we are done killing off the first one</p><ul><li>through copyrights - now its patents. Well we are not going to stand
for this any more; I am hoping Red Hat and Novell stand strong and fight
this; and I hope the lawyers at the <a href=http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/>Open Invention
Network</a> and <a href=http://www.softwarefreedom.org/>the Software Freedom
Law center</a> seriously consider a
pre-emptive attack on you. We&rsquo;re all peace loving hippies in open source
right? Wrong, wrong and now I think it is time we make YOU pay&mldr;..</li></ul></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
