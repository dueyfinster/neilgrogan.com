BlackBook as some call it)! It will be a Black, 2Ghz Core Duo, 1 GB RAM, 120
GB HDD (5400 RPM) MacBook, complete with a remote, Bluetooth 2 and Wifi
functionality. Not mention cool applications such as iSight built in Camera,
Front Row ( a media center) and Spotlight search technology. It cost me close
to â‚¬2.000, so hopefully it will be worth it ;-)</p><p>I have also joined, for a month, a commercial darknet. Don&rsquo;t know what that
is? It is basically me paying for an extra layer of security, 128-bit
encryption to a Swedish Internet service provider. Why? Well that means that
if my ISP ever got a court order from a company, they would not have any
records on me, since it will be encrypted, leaving them with no trace of what
I have been upto. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I am a totally law abiding person, and
the law says I have a right to privacy. I am just enforcing that right, in
case my ISP was collecting anything (BT is my ISP), like my passwords. I also
share my connection through my FON router, so as I will be using VPN encrypted
network, I can prove 100% it wasn&rsquo;t me who abused my internet connection,
clearing me of liability. <a href=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060815-7502.html title="Swedish Commercial Darknet">Ars Technica has an interesting article on the
matter</a>. That said, I have heard little of file sharing
implications in Irish Law.</p><p>Also, I am one of the newest members of the FON community Wifi project. What
the hell is this I hear you ask? Basically you share your internet connection,
either for free (like I do)or for a small fee to others. If you share yours
for free, you get free access to other FON routers worldwide. If however you
&ldquo;milk your wifi&rdquo; (aka. make people pay) you hve to pay to use other
foneros[sic] routers.</p><p>I see Leaving Cert results are out today! I am not looking forward to the year
ahead, my last year of secondary school, 6th Year. I will be sitting the
Leaving Cert next June, and well to say its no easy task to do well would be
an understatement! I do Physics, German, Engineering, Irish, English, Maths,
Geography which all will be tested! I wish everyone who has done it, the very
best of luck this year, and I hope they all get the results they want. Each of
your six best subjects is picked, all weighted on points and automatically
submitted to the Central Applications office which holds a list of
predetermined points on courses in registered institutions. Based on the
availabilty (read &ldquo;supply and demand&rdquo;) is whether you get the course, as
points fluctuate. They have rounds of offers, until all places are filled. No
idea what I want to do, but I am looking in the sub &lt;350 points range,
shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to achieve!</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
