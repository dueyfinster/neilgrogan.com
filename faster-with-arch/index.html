If you have never heard about Arch Linux,
it is a &ldquo;<em>roll your own</em>&rdquo; Linux distribution. This basically means from start to finish, the whole
process is custom. Whether your system has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or sound is totally up to you.</p><p>I switched from Ubuntu Linux, which is very much built for new people to Linux. I have been using Ubuntu
since it&rsquo;s release in 2004 (as old as this blog incidentally). I have found it slowly moving away from my
power user needs from the release of the KDE 4.0 desktop up to the recently introduced Unity desktop for
Ubuntu. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love the whizz-bang effects of the snazzier distributions (like Ubuntu) and
have used it to show people the power of Linux (and how really groundbreaking Compiz effects were at the
time, ~2005). It&rsquo;s sad Compiz hasn&rsquo;t got the kudos but since both Windows and OS X have copied from Compiz,
some more usability has been gained.</p><p>But alas these features aren&rsquo;t really for me. I work professionally with computers all day and what matters
to me most now are speed and efficiency. I am not productive if a desktop issue causes a slow-down (as Aero
often does on Windows) or even a crash (Mac spinning beach ball, anyone?).</p><p>The <strong>most</strong> important reason why I switched to Arch itself is because of the rolling
release feature. It doesn&rsquo;t have set releases like Ubuntu (every six months) but updates constantly.
This suits my workflow a lot better because a lot of software I use on Linux gets very regular updates
now (Chromium, Eclipse, Calibre, Firefox, Amarok, etc). I also hate upgrades between releases and I
think smaller more manageable updates (even if small issues arise) will provide a much better experience.</p><p>After all there&rsquo;s only so much coffee you can drink when your machine is taking a long time to respond!</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/linux>#linux</a></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><script src=../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
