Records DRM. I <a href=http://www.riaaradar.com/ title="RIAA Radar">looked up some of my favourite
artists</a> to see if they were
part of the &ldquo;MAFIAA&rdquo; that is the
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</a>
(Recording Industry Association of America), not surprisingly some were
(70% of sold music worldwide is put out by this cartel). I got rather
confused when a Franz Ferdinand album appeared on the list, when their
debut album did not. Seems the record label did a deal with Sony for
distribution. I found a piece of information quite old now (May 2006),
but interesting anyway:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Opponents also challenge the idea that back catalogue revenues
provide investment for new ventures and to support new artists. Peter
Jameson of the BPI (British Phonographic Industry) argued in The
Guardian on 24 April that such investment had contributed to a boom in
new British music, citing artists such as Arctic Monkeys, James Blunt
and Kaiser Chiefs. However, Arctic Monkeys are with Domino Records,
which was founded in 1993 and rarely re-releases records that predate
itself, and James Blunt was signed by the US label Custard Records,
which was set up only in 2004 and so has little back catalogue
material to release; the same is true of Kaiser Chiefs, who are signed
to B-Unique, which was also founded in 2004. Those are hardly good
examples of recording companies that rely on significant revenue from
the back catalogue profits that would be under threat if we were to
stick at the 50-year copyright term.&rdquo; ( Via <a href=http://drn.okfn.org/node/124 title="Quote from Digital Rights Network">Digital Rights

thing very interesting, will the greedy dinosaurs of the recording
industry win? Or will technologists like <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1904758034876244745&q=corey+doctorow+drm+microsoft" title="Corey Doctorows DRM Talk at Microsoft">Corey

or <a href=http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/ title="Steve Jobs">Steve

suceed in getting the point across? After all you don&rsquo;t see many
technologists being record bosses!</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
