This site is made with [Jekyll][] static website generator and hosted on [FastMail][]. Mirrors are also posted to [Github][] & [Gitlab][]. The theme is one I adapted from the default Jekyll theme. SSL is freely provided by [LetsEncrypt][].

I author the site (usually) in the excellent [Vim][] text editor, using [Markdown][] for posts and HTML/CSS/Javascript for the rest. An odd time I may write a post using [Editorial][] on iOS.

To post the site to various mirrors and the main host, I use [TravisCI][], [CircleCI][] and [AppVeyor][].
