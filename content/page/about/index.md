Software Engineering Manager at [Ericsson][] in [Athlone, Ireland][Athlone], managing teams in JEE, UX, UI and [5G][] Topology. Before that, I was a Senior Software Engineer in [MediaKind][] and [Ericsson][] working across Java and C# projects.

I originally graduated with a first class honours degree in computer science at  
[Technological University, Dublin][TUD]. I also 
graduated with a first class masters in computer science from [University College Dublin][UCD]. See the [Colophon][] if you're interested to know how I put this site together.
