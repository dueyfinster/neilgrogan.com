### Editor + Terminal

For Editor I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and
[Vim](https://www.vim.org)/[Neovim](https://www.neovim.io). I also use
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/emacs) for the excellent [org-mode]().

For shell I use [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) with [OhMyZSH](https://ohmyz.sh)
installed. For terminal I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)/Terminal.app but I
have also tried Alacritty/kitty on occasion.

[My dotfiles are here](https://github.com/dueyfinster/dotfiles)

### Desktop Apps

For web browser - I usually use Safari - unless the website doesn't work or I
need better DevTools then I'll use Firefox or Chrome.

For RSS reader I use the excellent [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) (mac/iOS).

For work, I use Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint and Word - I never use these on a
personal machine (I use Apple iWork suite on rare occasion).

### Backup Strategy

I host my files on a Synology NAS and back it up to Rsync.net - with mirrors to
local USB and cloud sync where needed.

### Mobile setup

- [Framework 13 AMD](https://frame.work) - runs [NixOS](https://nixos.org)

On my phone (iPhone 15 Pro) I use:

- [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app) for Git
- [Blink](https://blink.sh) as terminal
- [mosh](https://mosh.org) to keep sessions open anywhere
