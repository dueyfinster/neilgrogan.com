### Editor + Terminal
For Editor I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Vim](https://www.vim.org)/[Neovim](https://www.neovim.io). I also use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/emacs) for the excellent [org-mode]().

For shell I use [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) with [OhMyZSH](https://ohmyz.sh) installed. For terminal I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)/Terminal.app but I have also tried Alacritty/kitty on occasion.

[My dotfiles are herei](https://github.com/dueyfinster/dotfiles)

### Desktop Apps
For web browser - I usually use Safari - unless the website doesn't work or I need better DevTools then I'll use Firefox or Chrome.

For RSS reader I use the excellent [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) (mac/iOS).

For work, I use Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint and Word - I never use these on a personal machine (I use Apple iWork suite on rare occasion).

### Backup Strategy
I host my files on a Synology NAS and back it up to Rsync.net - with mirrors to local USB and cloud sync where needed.
