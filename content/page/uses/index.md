### Editor + Terminal

For Editor I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and
[Vim](https://www.vim.org)/[Neovim](https://www.neovim.io).

For shell I use [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) with [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
installed. For terminal I use [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) but I
am also trying [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).

[My dotfiles are here](https://github.com/dueyfinster/dotfiles)

### Desktop Apps

For web browser - I usually use Safari and Firefox.

For RSS reader I use the excellent [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) (mac/iOS).

For work, I use Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint and Word - I never use these on a
personal machine (I use Apple iWork suite on rare occasion).

### Backup Strategy

I host my files on a Synology NAS and back it up to Rsync.net - with mirrors to
local USB and cloud sync where needed.

### Mobile setup

- [Framework 13 AMD 7040](https://frame.work) - runs [NixOS](https://nixos.org)

On my phone (iPhone 15 Pro) I use:

- [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app) for Git
- [Blink](https://blink.sh) as terminal
- [mosh](https://mosh.org) to keep sessions open anywhere
