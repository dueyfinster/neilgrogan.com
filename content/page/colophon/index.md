This site is made with [Hugo][] static website generator (using [Noteworthy theme][]), posted to [Github][]  and hosted on [FastMail][]. SSL is freely provided by [LetsEncrypt][].

I author the site (usually) in the excellent [Vim][] text editor, using [Org mode][]/[Markdown][] for posts and HTML/CSS/Javascript for the rest. An odd time I may write a post using [Editorial][] on iOS.
