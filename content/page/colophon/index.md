This site is made with [Hugo][] static website generator (using [Noteworthy theme][]), posted to [Github][] - synced to a private [Gitea][] instance - which kicks off a build of the site on a private [Drone][] instance and will rsync the result to [FastMail][]. SSL is freely provided by [LetsEncrypt][].

I author the site (usually) in [Vim][], [Emacs][] or online in Github, using [Org mode][] for posts and [Markdown][]/HTML/CSS/Javascript for the rest.
