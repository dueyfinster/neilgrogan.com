A great guide to get up to speed with Fish shell. What is Fish? It's a shell
written from the ground up to be more easily understandable the the traditional
shells (bash, tcsh). I don't know yet if I'll switch (anything you can do in
Fish can be made to work in Bash). It's an interesting concept and I'll try it
for a while...
