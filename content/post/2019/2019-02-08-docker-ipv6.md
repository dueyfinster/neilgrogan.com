title: Using IPv6 with Docker Compose on Ubuntu Server
---

I recently started using [PiHole][] to block ads on my home network. As the name
suggests, you install it on a [raspberry pi][]. I left it in situ for about a 
month, until I decided I wanted to swap out the pi, but keep PiHole.

The natural solution to this, is to use a docker container. Rather helpfully, 
there is a publicly available [docker build of PiHole][pihole-docker]. Simple, 
right? Well my home network is also IPv6, thus the [DNS][] on the raspberrypi 
should be also. The problem is, [Docker has support for IPv6][ipv6], but it's 
not very straightforward with [Docker Compose][].

After a lot of fiddling about, I finally managed it. As per the Docker IPv6
documentation, on Linux (I used Ubuntu Server) you need to add a configuration
file to enable IPv6, at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```
{
  "ipv6": true,
  "fixed-cidr-v6": "2001:db8:1::/64"
}
```
Then you need to restart Docker daemon:

`$ sudo systemctl restart docker`

that will allow the new `daemon.json` file to take effect.

After this, I had an existing setup with [Plex][] and [other things][] already
controlled by `docker-compose`. The solution here is to kill all your
containers and recreate the compose network by hand with IPv6 subnet:

```
$ cd <my_compose_dir>
$ docker network ls # name of compose network should have directory name in it
$ docker network inspect <compose_net_name> # Make note of exisiting IPv4
Subnet/Gateway
$ docker-compose kill # Kill all your existing containers
$ docker network prune # Remove/Prune the network (as no more containers are attached)
$ docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 --gateway=172.18.0.1 --ipv6 --subnet=2001:db8:2::/64 <compose_net_name>
```

and lastly for the piece de resistance, let's bring up our compose containers:

`$ docker-compose up -d`

now we can also verify we get IPv6 working internally (see this [helpful post
here][ipv6-blog]):
```
$ docker run -itd ajeetraina/ubuntu-iproute bash # Start first container
$ docker run -itd ajeetraina/centos-iproute bash # Start second container (new
terminal)
```

In both containers you can run: 

`$ ifconfig eth0` 

which will show you the IPv6 address of each. Then from either container, you 
can ping the other with:

`$ ping6 <ipv6_address>`

and it all should work nicely!
