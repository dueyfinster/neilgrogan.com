title: Ubiquiti Home Network
---

Over the summer, I upgraded my home network to Ubiquiti gear. Ubiquiti do
business Wifi, all the way up to covering stadiums. I first heard about them
from [Troy Hunt][troy] and then again from [Marco Arment][marco] on [Accidental
Tech Podcast][atp]. Ubiquiti are popular in prosumer space - for people serious
about good [Wifi][wifi].

So far it's been an excellent experience and I'd highly recommend it. After
setting it up (there is a few moving pieces) it has been running without any
intervention from me. Being a professional product, it's not just a home router
(with inbuilt wifi), there is a few more pieces you need to buy:

1. [Gateway][gw] - this connects to your home router, and serves as an access
   point (approx. €120)
2. [Switch][sw] - this is to distribute the internet from the gateway to all
   other devices (approx. €105) [plugs in to Gateway]
3. [Cloud Key][ck] - this is the management 'computer' that gives you a web
   control panel to control all the Ubiquiti gear (approx. €85) [plugs in to Switch]
4. [Wireless Access point][ap] - this is the 'Antenna' which actually gives you
   wifi (approx. €90) [plugs in to Switch]

Basic connection diagram would be like this:

```

Your Wifi Devices
```

This is the basic Ubiquiti setup, you need to purchase at least 4 devices to
give you Wifi. So at this point, you may think it's all expensive and you'd be
right. For the 4 devices, you are looking at at least €400 outlay - which is
much more expensive then even the high-end Wifi routers from Netgear etc.

The big advantage is: expandability and ease of control. The Ubiquiti dashboard
is highly configurable, you can search for Wifi channels which the neighbours
aren't using. Also, if you have dead spots in your house, no problem, just buy
another Wireless Access Point and plug it in: job done!

Another big advantage for me, if I change internet service provider, I just plug
a new modem in to my gateway. Nothing changes (like IP addresses) for my local
devices. Also, you could configure Ubiquiti gateway to have two connections
(like cable modem and 4G modem connected) and load balance or fail-over between
them - but I haven't gone that crazy (yet!). Also, if a new standard of Wifi
comes? Just pop on another access point.

Overall I'm very happy with the setup. It feels like an investment that you get
payback over time on, so I'm looking forward to being able to manage my network
much easier and incrementally upgrade over time with much less hassle.
