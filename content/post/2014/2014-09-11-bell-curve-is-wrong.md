title: Bell Curve is Wrong
---

Interesting study here: apparently performance of people in a company is never
related to a bell curve, but is more like a ski slope. So the majority of people
are carried by the few in terms of performance. What I really want to know is
pay for these people like a ski slope? Cause I bet it ain't.
