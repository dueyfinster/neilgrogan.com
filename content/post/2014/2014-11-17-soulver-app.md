My favourite text number crunching app on iOS bar none is [Soulver][]. What makes it the best?

* Fast to load 
* Simple user interface that gets out of the way
* Contextual Keyboards (my favourite is the currency keyboard)
* Can reuse calculations from previous lines (and name calculations).
* iCloud sync

[Soulver][] is great for when a spreadsheet is just to heavy. I use it a lot for it currency conversion, makes it easy to have multiple line items in different currencies (say GBP & USD) and get a total in one (EUR). Also for splitting the bills at a resturant, each line could be a food item (so if two desserts cost the same, you can see quickly and only add lines relevant for each participant).
