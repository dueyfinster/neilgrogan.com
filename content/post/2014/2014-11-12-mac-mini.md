I recently purchased a Mac Mini Server, for this site to run on. It's hosted on
my home broadband connection, but it's just really for small time side-projects
like this site. Also it's a way to play around with Docker, VirtualBox, Node.js
and all those other fun technologies I don't get time for.

I don't really plan to post links, but maybe I'll review things or cover things
I've bought.
