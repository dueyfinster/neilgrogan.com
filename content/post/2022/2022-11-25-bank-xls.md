title: Convert Bank Transactions XLS to CSV in Python
---

I've written previously on importing transactions to hledger/[ledger][] from [KBC][] bank in JavaScript and [PTSB][] bank in Python. I took different approaches to each:

* For KBC, you needed to log in and run Javascript which scrape the transaction table and download it formatted as CSV
* For PTSB, the script automatted logging in, get the transaction table and save locally as CSV

Both approaches are valid - but suffer from the same issues: any change the bank makes to it website needs to be updated in the code. The KBC/JavaScript approach was a bit more robust in that it would just search for rows on a website and download as CSV.

With the EU payment services directive (PSD2) - banks have had to add two-factor authentication which hampers using an automated approach to log in and download. I've updated my original PTSB script to handle 2FA - buit it's taken the magic out of it and made it feel very manual. So I've decided to change the approach again - just download the Excel transaction file the provide and convert to CSV. It should be much easier to maintain - I just need to be careful of which row transactions start/end and which columns to ignore.


Here's my latest Python script to convert Permanent TSB Excel file to CSV:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import glob
import xlrd
import csv


def read_xls(file, start_row):
    wb = xlrd.open_workbook(file)
    sh = wb.sheet_by_index(0)
    rows = []
    for rownum in range(start_row, sh.nrows):
        li = sh.row_values(rownum)
        del li[1]
        del li[-2]
        rows.append(li)
    del rows[-1]
    return rows

def write_csv(filename, header, rows):
    csv_file = open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf8')
    wr = csv.writer(csv_file)
    wr.writerow(header)
    for row in rows:
        wr.writerow(row)

def main():
    path = "*.xls"
    start_row=13
    rows = read_xls(glob.glob(path)[0], start_row)
    header = ['Date', 'Desc', 'Amount In', 'Amount Out', 'Balance']
    filename = 'ptsb.csv'
    write_csv(filename, header, rows)


if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()

```
