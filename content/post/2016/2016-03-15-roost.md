I backed the Roost laptop stand on [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.org),
which already had a successful run in their first Kickstarter campaign. I've
been delighted with the result so far, it lives up to the promises of being
super light but yet durable and strong. Here's a photo of it:

It came with a really nice case which holds the Roost underneath and has pockets
for a portable keyboard (I use a [Logitech
K811](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/illuminated-keyboard-for-mac-ipad-iphone))
and mouse (I use a [Logitech Marathon
M705](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/marathon-mouse-m705)). It works
great for a really comfortable and ergonomic desk wherever you may travel (or
set up to work). Highly recommended!
