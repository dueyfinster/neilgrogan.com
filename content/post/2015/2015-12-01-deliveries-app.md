title: Deliveries App

[Deliveries](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ie/app/deliveries-a-package-tracker/id290986013?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4PJ)
helps you track packages from major shopping (Amazon, Apple) as well as nearly
every major package distribution company like DHL, UPS and FedEx. I've used the
app for years and it's really impressed me.

It can sync via iCloud or the Junecloud cloud service by the makers of the app,
Junecloud (not confusing at all, hey!). It started on the Mac as a simple
dashboard widget (for those of you who remember those, rarely used these days),
but it's since grown to have
[its own Mac app also](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ie/app/deliveries-a-package-tracker/id924726344?mt=12&uo=4&at=1001l4PJ).
Considering many people will have a lot of packages coming from everywhere this
Christmas, it's definitely a really useful app to have!
