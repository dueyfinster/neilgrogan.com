I follow Casey Liss' blog and recently he had a great post about a [technology
"go pack"][casey]. Lifehacker has written about [this][lh1] [over][lh2]
[the][lh3] [years][lh4], and the Wirecutter has a great article [I shared here
on this very blog][wirecutter]. Also Casey linked to a great post by [Katie
Floyd][katie] on Twitter:

I finally took the hint / inspiration from all these posts, and I decided time
was right to put together my own "go bag". Here's a picture of my tech go bag:

## What's in my (tech) go bag:

### Case

- The bag is the largest of these three: [3 x BUBM CARRY BAG CASE ][bubm],
  really good value these bags
- [Cocoon GRID-IT Organiser - Small (black)][organiser] - plan to use this with
  battery charger and retractable cables on day trips

### Cables

- 2 of [AmazonBasics Apple-Certified Retractable Lightning to USB Cable 2
  ft][retract]
- [CHARGEKEY | Lightning Cable, Key Sized][chargekey]
- Apple Earpods
- Headphone splitter - purchased for &euro; 1.50 in a discount store
- Ethernet cable - bog standard, was in drawer
- 4-Port USB charger with removable plug heads - no idea where I got this!?!?
  Probably [DX.com][], although I certainly bought others like this there and
  they are very poor quality, avoid!

and to keep these organised:

- [Fisual Chunky Reuseable Hook & Loop Cable Ties - 20 Pack Black][ties] - use
  these to tie cables, also use them around the house, very handy!

## Devices

- [EasyAcc 10000mAh Ultra Slim Dual USB (2.1A / 1.5A Output) Portable Power
  Bank][easyacc]
- [Edimax BR-6258nL N150 Wireless Personal Hotspot & Travel Route][edimax] -
  bought this after seeing Katie Floyd's recommendation
- [Sennheiser PXC 310 BT Headphones][senn] - lasted well for years, had these
  since 2012

# Other Holiday Travel stuff / bags

Also with the tech go bag, I've created a toiletry bag, contact lens bag etc.
This goes with Ebags I bought in 2014, which have been great for travel. I
bought some of these from Amazon and then from Ikea and I'm going to see which
lasts longer :)

- [Microfibre Towel (Purple), travel towel][towel]
- [Vango Pac Packable Rucksack][backpack] vs. [IKEA KNALLA Backpack][knalla]
- [7 Piece Air Travel Bottle Set ][bottle] vs. [UPPTÄCKA Travel Bottles,
  assorted colours][upp]
- [UPPTÄCKA Toilet bag, dark blue][toiletry bag]
- [UPPTÄCKA Packing bag, set of 4][pack bag] vs [eBags Packing Cubes][ebags] (I
  bought before)
- [Mens/Ladies Hanging Large Toiletry Wash Bag][toilet bag 2] - bought before,
  hasn't lasted as well as I would have hoped.
- [Vapur Eclipse Reusable Plastic Water Bottle][water]
