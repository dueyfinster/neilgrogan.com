[Editorial](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4PJ "editorial") is an iPhone and iPad plain text editor that's great for markdown[^1]. It also has some nifty automation workflows, in which you can use Python scripts. These can search the web, scrape data, transform text and much moreâ€¦

I pretty much wrote this blog post (and many more) in Editorial. It's much better then the competition for markdown in particular. [Byword](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/byword/id482063361?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4PJ "byword") is an obvious competitor, which I really can't recommend (nothing inherently wrong with Byword, just doesn't suit me). [MacStories has an in -depth Editorial review](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/editorial-1-2-brings-powerful-new-text-editing-features-more-ios-automation/), which is well worth a long read.
