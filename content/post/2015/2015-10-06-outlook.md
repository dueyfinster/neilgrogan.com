title:
  Automatically Decline and Delete or Accept and Delete Outlook 2010 Meetings
---

You can follow the
[Microsoft TechNet guide to add VisualBasic code in Outlook rules](https://web.archive.org/web/20151016112956/http://blogs.technet.com/b/sharepoint_republic/archive/2011/12/09/outlook-rule-to-auto-accept-or-auto-decline-meeting-invites.aspx).

You can just replace the code they give with this:

```vb
Sub AutoDeclineMeetings(oRequest As MeetingItem)

' If its not a meeting, we don't process
If oRequest.MessageClass <> "IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request" Then
    Exit Sub
End If

' Get the appointment in the meeting
Dim oAppt As AppointmentItem
Set oAppt = oRequest.GetAssociatedAppointment(True)

' Send a decline response
Dim oResponse
    Set oResponse = oAppt.Respond(olMeetingDeclined, True)
    oResponse.Send

' Lastly, delete the message
oRequest.Delete
End Sub

Sub AutoAcceptMeetings(oRequest As MeetingItem)

' If its not a meeting, we don't process
If oRequest.MessageClass <> "IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request" Then
    Exit Sub
End If

' Get the appointment in the meeting
Dim oAppt As AppointmentItem
Set oAppt = oRequest.GetAssociatedAppointment(True)

' Send an accept response
Dim oResponse
    Set oResponse = oAppt.Respond(olMeetingAccepted, True)
    oResponse.Send

' Lastly, (optionally) delete the message
'oRequest.Delete
End Sub

```

For anything else you may want to do with the meeting, check the
[Outlook Visual Basic Developer Docs](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/dn320338(v=office.15)>).
