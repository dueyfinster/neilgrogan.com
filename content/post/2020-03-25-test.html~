title: Test blog with Org-mode

<div id="outline-container-org90a1f41" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org90a1f41">Why blog with Org mode?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org90a1f41">
<blockquote>
<p>
Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and project
planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like most things in the Emacs world, this description of <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a> belies the
true depth of what it can do. Mostly I use Org mode only superficially as a way
to track notes and projects, using it as a tree of tasks and the status of each.
However, Org mode is good at many other tasks, not least of those is authoring
content. I write most of the posts in this blog using markdown, but since I am
in Emacs anyway and Org mode is a much richer authoring tool I decided to give
it a go.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that motivated the change was Sam Halliday's book <a href="https://leanpub.com/fpmortals">Functional Programming for Mortals</a> which is written entirely in Org mode. As well as
as having no problem with code, images and text, the book even embeds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)">DOT (graph description language)</a> to
define and render diagrams inline in the org manuscript.
</p>

<p>
Just a heads up, I host the blog (at the time of writing) on Github Pages which
uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator ideal for blogs and other content creation.
Some of the information here is not relavent if you don't use Jekyll, but you
can still use these steps to generate HTML and upload that to your site.
</p>

<p>
I followed the steps in this post on <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html">Using org to Blog with Jekyll</a> with some
modifications to get everything working.
</p>

<h2 id="orgfdb14d0">How to author content with Org mode</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfdb14d0">
<p>
In my blog repository I made a new folder <code>org/posts</code>. In the <code>org</code> folder I
added an Emacs Lisp file <code>publish.el</code> which contains some code to set up the
publishing parameters for later.
</p>

<p>
Then you can create a blog post in the <code>org/posts</code> folder which must be named
with the usual convention, but with an <code>.org</code> extension instead of <code>.md</code> or <code>.html</code>.
</p>

<p>
For example:
<code>org/posts/2020-03-15-beware-the-ides-of-march.org</code>
</p>

<p>
You can structure your post just like an org file and the headlines will map to
headings and sub-headings in your post. All of the formatting
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"You can format quotes using the quote directive."
  ― Emacs User
#+END_QUOTE
</pre>

<p>
Would be rendered as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"You can format quotes using the quote directive."
  ― Emacs User
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By preceding items with <code>1.</code> or <code>*</code> you can make lists, which can be nested:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First item</li>
<li>Another item
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nested first item</li>
<li>Second nested item</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Behold, a third item</li>
</ol>

<p>
You can have <i>italics by wrapping words</i> in forward slashes. You can <b>bold</b> a
word with asterisks. <i><b>Both at once</b></i> is of course also allowed.
</p>

<p>
Using equals will <code>emphasize things</code> and tildes can be used for inline code <code>val
x = y + 1</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can use special symbols like &pound;100 and <i>&copy;2020 Justin Heyes-Jones</i> and
mathematical symbols like &lambda; and &pi;. See <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-symbols.html">Symbols in Org mode</a> for the full list.
</p>

<p>
Images can be included by using a file link (without a description if you want
to inline the image), and you can modify the HTML attributes as follows:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+CAPTION: Photo by Rumman Amin on Unsplash
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt A nice cup of coffee :width 400
[[../../../images/rumman-amin-bJzJH85Kp7g-unsplash.jpg]]
</pre>

<p>
Which renders the image inline:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../../images/rumman-amin-bJzJH85Kp7g-unsplash.jpg" alt="A nice cup of coffee" width="400" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Photo by Rumman Amin on Unsplash</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1ba04a0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1ba04a0">Source code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1ba04a0">
<p>
Since you're reading my technical blog you may be the sort of person that likes
to share code. Org mode supports source code (you can even run it and pass the
variables around to other parts of the document). Just wrap your code in a
<code>#+BEGIN_SRC</code> and <code>#+END_SRC</code> block. The code will be highlighted using whatever
configuration you have already for that mode, you can optionally have line
numbers using the <code>-n</code> option:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="font-weight: bold;">require</span> '<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">company</span>)

(<span style="font-weight: bold;">defun</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">custom-dictionary-company-backend</span> (command <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">&amp;optional</span> arg <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">&amp;rest</span> ignored)
  <span style="font-style: italic;">"Company mode backend for a custom dictionary stored as a radix tree."</span>
  (<span style="font-weight: bold;">case</span> command
    ('init    
     (<span style="font-weight: bold;">unless</span> (boundp 'custom-dictionary-company--words-tree)
         (<span style="font-weight: bold;">setq</span> custom-dictionary-company--words-tree (tree-from-file <span style="font-style: italic;">"dictionary.el"</span>))))
    ('prefix
     (company-grab-word))
    ('candidates
     (radix-tree-keys custom-dictionary-company--words-tree (downcase arg)))
    ('ignore-case
     'keep-prefix)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And some Scala code with line numbers
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scala"><span class="linenr"> 1: </span>def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
<span class="linenr"> 2: </span>

I diverged from the guide I was following. Firstly I made a file <code>publish.el</code>
which contains the code required to configure the publishing of the blog, and
modified it so that instead of hard coded paths it just uses relative paths to
make things easier. To publish a blog you need to just evaluate this file once
in a session and run <code>org-publish-all</code> to publish all your Org projects, or
<code>org-publish</code> to select just one.
</p>

<pre class="example">
;; -*- flycheck-disabled-checkers: (emacs-lisp-checkdoc); byte-compile-warnings: (not free-vars) -*-
;; Run this then M-x org-publish

(setq project-root (locate-dominating-file "." "_config.yml"))

(setq org-publish-project-alist
  `(
    ("org-justinhj"
     ;; Path to your org files.
     :base-directory ,(concat project-root "org/posts")
     :base-extension "org"
     ;; Path to your Jekyll project.
     :publishing-directory ,(concat project-root "_posts")
     :recursive t
     :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
     :section-numbers nil
     :headline-levels 4
     :html-extension "html"
     :body-only t
     )
    ))
</pre>

<p>
Publishing will create HTML versions of the posts in Jekyll's <code>_posts</code> folder
and then you can build your site and view it locally before pushing to Github
Pages.

One thing I'm not sure about is if I like using Emacs's code blocks instead of
embedded Github gists. It's certainly possible to use either. Anyway I plan to
do a few future blogs using this method and see how it works out.
