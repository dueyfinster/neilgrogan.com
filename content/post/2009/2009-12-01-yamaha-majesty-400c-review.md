title: Yamaha Majesty 400c Review
---

I own a Majesty 125cc
2002. The video below is the updated (and more powerful) model:

(Some of the) New features:  
-   2x the amount of space
-   Parking break (for hills! Think handbrake if your a car driver)  
-   Liquid-cooled 400cc  
-   ABS brakes
-   Dual Halogen Headlights
-   Larger rear lights
-   Csr-like oversize dials on dash

It looks good, good, good. I haven't looked at price, but my last two
bikes are Yamaha and I've had little trouble with them. I like the
bigger bikes that have loads of built in storage (panniers look a bit
unnatural) and a bike that's confident in itself to not have to show off
it's braun but rather it's brains with good safety and road handling ;)
