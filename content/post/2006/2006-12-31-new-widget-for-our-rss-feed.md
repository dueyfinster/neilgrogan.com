Widget](http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/1396/picture2tn0.png 'Duey Finsters
RSS Widget')

Thanks to Dashcode, the tool for making dashboard widgets, there is now an RSS
one for this site! Currently it only works on [Mac OS X][], but [KDE][] 4 should
support dashboard widgets (they are really just bits of javascript, css and
html).
