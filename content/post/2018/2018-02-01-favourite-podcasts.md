Over the last while I've been collecting wonderful podcast episodes from the hundreds of hours I've listened to. I've even workshopped some of my favourites with colleagues and friends (they all approve!). Luckily a neat service called [HuffDuffer](https://huffduffer.com/) allows you to create a personalised feed from episodes spanning any podcast you see fit. All you need is a direct link to the MP3 or indeed any format audio file.

So here it is, my favourite episodes spanning many podcasts. Mostly I love good stories, with unexpected twists. I suppose you could simplify that to "Surprise and Delight". Be prepared to be entertained, surprised and delighted...
