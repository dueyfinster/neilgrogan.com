I recently bought a [Framework 13](https://frame.work) laptop as a personal
machine. If you are not aware - Framework makes build-it-yourself laptops. I
wanted to review different parts of the process and give an overview of how
it's been from ordering to delivery.

## Ordering

Ordering was easy, the configurator they have for choosing the specification
you want is very clear. The only criticism I'd have is that it gets
confusing as to which stock keeping units (SKU) gets the upgraded camera and
screen - two parts they they clearly have a generation two for. I couldn't
see when I finished the order that I had definitely ordered the later versions of both.
It was easy to configure everything else like RAM, CPU, SSD and I really liked
the "choose for me" modules section - which picks the most common ports to add
to the laptop. I paid my â‚¬100 and got a confirmation email with a waiting time
of the end of September 2024.


## Delivery
Communication was very good - I got regular emails informing me when shipping
would occur. I really liked that they confirmed multiple times the payment card
for which the remaining money would charged to. Shipping was by Fedex and came
direct from Taiwan to Ireland in about 5 days - which I didn't think was too bad
I've certainly seen longer lead times. It was shipped by the estimated date and
again communication was good in flagging a potential delay which fortunately
did not come to pass.

## Setup
For context, I'm well used to building PCs and tinkering with things - so this
was not an especially arduous build. The laptop came in a what seemed like many,
many boxes but really there was a few key ones: laptop shell which included
screen and motherboard. The next most important box was the "top case" which is
keyboard, trackpad and everything you "touch". Before attaching the top case
you must install your RAM & SSD and then should insert the "ports" (plug and
play modules on the side like USB-C, HDMI etc. depending on what you ordered).
After that really it's attaching the top case with it's ribbon cable, installing
the bezel (it has magnets and light stickers) and then screwing the top case in.

## Thoughts so far
I'm really enjoying the Framework laptop so far. The ordering, shipping and
build process have all been positive. The problem I have is I'm very used to
Apple Mac laptops (both the Pro line-up and Air line-up) and they really are the
gold standard for laptops. The Framework 2K screen is great (I like matte more and
more - it's growing on me), the keyboard is reasonably good (on a par I think
with Macbooks) but the trackpad is just awful unfortunately. I'm trying my best
to retrain my brain to tap lightly and not click, but the Apple ones have me
spoiled rotten. The battery life is also meh, I've splurged on a power bank but
again this is Apple killing it with outrageously good battery life on M-series
chips in their laptops.

I installed [NixOS](https://nixos.org) Linux on it and customised it to run
[Sway](https://sway-wm.org). The only hiccup I had was how to disable secure
boot. You can see [my config here](https://github.com/dueyfinster/nixos-config).

Overall I would definitely buy again - I think for a Linux or Windows laptop
that has an X86 Intel or AMD chip it really is one of the better ones. If you
were spoiled by Macs previously - just beware of the trade-offs going in. So far
I'm really loving the customisability I have in Linux vs MacOS. Using a proper
tiling window manager like Sway can definitely be more productive!
