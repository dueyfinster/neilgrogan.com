Today marks [20 years since I first blogged](/dueyfinster). I wanted to give a
little context to that post.

I actually remember it quite vividly, I was in my cousins' house on their Dell
Desktop PC. I had heard of this thing called "blogging" but really it was of no
interest to 15 year old me at the time. The only thing that could make blogging
interesting for me: I heard of this mythical new service called "Gmail". Gmail
of course from a company I already thought was cool: Google. Unfortunately for
me - this new "Gmail" I heard about a few months before was US only.

Then the rumours started to fly: Google was opening up Gmail to more users. What
was a surefire way to get it? Create a Blogger account - a company that Google
acquired. So I duly did that and wrote the [first post](/dueyfinster). If you're
curious - I'm now convinced it made exactly and precisely zero difference. What
eventually got me that coveted gmail account was having different cousins based
in the United States who could invite me directly. I finally got
dueyfinster@gmail.com ! (Only to lose access sometime later, I assumed Gmail
would open up usernames after a period of inactivity like Hotmail did. Spoiler:
It doesn't.)

I am not really sure of the lesson in all of this - bar time really does change
things. It was exciting times - here's to the next 20 years of sporadic posts on
anything that takes my interest!
