happen to the Internet. Fell free to email your opinions to them directly: **
<a href=DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov>DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov</a>**. As a net citizen, get your voice heard on
the most important public debate of our times! Dear Sir/Madam, I, as a
citizen of Ireland and the EU, think with respect, the Internet should have a
world governing body, fairly appointed by each country who has more than 30%
of their respective populations online. For those under 30% they should get to
have a sub-committee, to prioritise and promote the Internet in their
countries. I think while although ICANN has generally not been a bad governing
body, vast improvements can be made, such as not allowing pressure from
companies to increase domain prices, when the cost of providing them has come
down dramatically over the past few years. I do recognise, that the Internet
was partially created with the help of U.S. government funding, but this comes
from the people of America, who would want the Internet to be a force for
change, like for example, the way it is helping Chinese dissidents.Also, as
with all US government generated ideas, it is free from patent and copyright
which applies worldwide, such as NASA images, for example. This should be true
of the Internet also, as it is with GPS (which I use regularly, Thanks for
that!). I am not a whole believer in the U.N. however, I think the Internet
governing body should be free form all Government and International
organisational pressures (but not those that seek to limit abuse, such as
child pornography, obviously). I thank you for offering a public debate on
this issue and I sincerely hope the outcome will be of benefit to everyone
living on earth.</p><p>Thank you,<br>Neil Grogan</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/politics>#politics</a></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><script src=../js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
