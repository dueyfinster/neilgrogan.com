I haven&rsquo;t found a purpose for it<img src=http://wiki.dueyfinster.eu/skins/tango/tango-logo.gif alt="DueyFinsters Logo" title="Duey
Finsters Logo"> yet, but I&rsquo;d like to have it all set up incase one day I turn
out to need it (maybe for collaboration or something?). If you have any skill
at themin&rsquo; <a href=http://www.mediawiki.org title=MediaWiki>MediaWiki</a> (the most popular wiki software, run but
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page>Wikipedia</a>, no less) please, please get in touch! I would do it all myself,
but my time is constrained at the moment, but I will eventually do it myself I
suppose ;-)</p><p>Some of you may have noticed downtime lately, that&rsquo;s because of the
wordpress.com domains add-on is a shambles, at least for dot-eu anyhoo.
Support tried to be helpful, and to be fair it was a new feature, but I wasted
$10 (about â‚¬7.50) for nothing, as I couldn&rsquo;t use dueyfinster.eu with it. Half
of it was perhaps my fault, as I couldn&rsquo;t use MX records (for redirecting mail
requests) to my <a href=https://www.google.com/a/ title="Google for your Domain">GFYD</a> so I tried to add more nameservers, having the first
pointing at Wordpress.com and the rest pointing at Google. Needless to say
after to-ing and fro-ing I decided to keep my self hosted solution, as it
offers total control (such as my own template, javascript, etc.). That is why
the site was down, it kept resolving at different locations :-( I got the
Macbook back from <a href=http://www.mactivate.ie title=Mactivate>Mactivate</a>, complete with a new logic board (aka. the PMU
I often and painfully referred to in my earlier posts).</p><p>I had a bit of a scare though, as less than two hours after I got it back, the
Macbook would only show the LED light when I tryed to power it on. I was
worried I&rsquo;d face at least another two weeks away from my laptop! I saw another
Apple knowledge base article, describing it could be the RAM unseated. I
popped off the battery, only to see the smallest phillips head screws you
could imagine. It took me well over a day to find a jewellers screwdriver
(luckily a relative of mine had one :-) ). I guess Apple do this, so it is
awkward to buy RAM from others. To my hope of all hopes, I popped the RAM out
and in, and hey presto it works! I have not had a problem since (fingers
crossed). Writing this post from it now by the way&mldr;&mldr;.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/apple>#apple</a></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
