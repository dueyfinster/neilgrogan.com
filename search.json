[{"content":"I’ve written previously on importing transactions to hledger/ledger from KBC bank in JavaScript and PTSB bank in Python. I took different approaches to each:\nFor KBC, you needed to log in and run Javascript which scrape the transaction table and download it formatted as CSV For PTSB, the script automatted logging in, get the transaction table and save locally as CSV Both approaches are valid - but suffer from the same issues: any change the bank makes to it website needs to be updated in the code. The KBC/JavaScript approach was a bit more robust in that it would just search for rows on a website and download as CSV.\nWith the EU payment services directive (PSD2) - banks have had to add two-factor authentication which hampers using an automated approach to log in and download. I’ve updated my original PTSB script to handle 2FA - buit it’s taken the magic out of it and made it feel very manual. So I’ve decided to change the approach again - just download the Excel transaction file the provide and convert to CSV. It should be much easier to maintain - I just need to be careful of which row transactions start/end and which columns to ignore.\nHere’s my latest Python script to convert Permanent TSB Excel file to CSV:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3 # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import glob import xlrd import csv def read_xls(file, start_row): wb = xlrd.open_workbook(file) sh = wb.sheet_by_index(0) rows = [] for rownum in range(start_row, sh.nrows): li = sh.row_values(rownum) del li[1] del li[-2] rows.append(li) del rows[-1] return rows def write_csv(filename, header, rows): csv_file = open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf8') wr = csv.writer(csv_file) wr.writerow(header) for row in rows: wr.writerow(row) def main(): path = \"*.xls\" start_row=13 rows = read_xls(glob.glob(path)[0], start_row) header = ['Date', 'Desc', 'Amount In', 'Amount Out', 'Balance'] filename = 'ptsb.csv' write_csv(filename, header, rows) if __name__ == '__main__': main() ","description":"","tags":["automation","python","code","programming"],"title":"Convert Bank Transactions XLS to CSV in Python","uri":"/bank-xls-csv/"},{"content":"I recently replaced a rusty satellite dish and faulty LNB (it has been in use in the house I moved in to for 10+ years I’d guess) and decided to try install one myself. Here in Ireland, the two main broadcast methods of receiving TV are satellite (Freesat / Sky) and terrestrial aerial (Saorview).\nAn issue I have one larger sitting room TV and one small living room TV. I couldn’t get both to be Samsung (out of stock on smallest sizes - which seem to be going out of fashion). So both TVs had very different methods of switching between satellite and aerial connections. I’m not sure if it is a hardware limitation (they make switching tuners slow to hide this), a licensing issue (broadcasters pay to be on the Freesat EPG for example) or a software issue (seems least likely). The fact multiple TV brands (in my case Phillips/Samsung) make it this clunky - makes me think it’s a licensing issue. I wanted to solve this by using an external box and having one mental model for navigating broadcast TV.\nAs I was busy researching the parts I need to fix the satellite - I thought I would look to address the issue of having one set of channels with a 7 day programme guide for Saorview and Freesat. I came across a thread on Boards.ie suggesting a Linux-based reciever box that is made in China: the Zgemma H7S. The specs on this reciever are good: 4K resolution, 2 Satellite Tuners and one terrestrial/cable tuner. Having two tuners of the same type is key here: it allows you to record and watch any channel at the same time. The operating system being Linux and that by nature being very easy to modify are a bonus ! Also you have a choice of which distribution you want to use (I got OpenViX pre-installed on mine) which leads to lots of choices in plugins and skins (how you want it to look).\nOne excellent feature is the ability to stream from this box, and use OpenWebif to configure the “bouquets” (groups of channels like News/Sport etc) or simply change the channels from your phone with the excellent tellymote. It can grab the bouquets from Sky/Freesat and the interface is very similar to Sky. It’s definitely not as seamless - you need to configure some plugins to update the 7-day Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) for example and every so often channels do move and rename themselves (so you should edit them in OpenWebIf to change/remove them from EPG). But overall I’m very happy with this solution!\n","description":"","tags":["linux","diy"],"title":"Linux, Freesat and Saorview","uri":"/linux-freesat-saorview/"},{"content":" Update 2023: these instructions are out-of-date for the latest Unifi controller software versions. It's preserved here as written for those who still have older versions. This post uses a file called gateway.config.json and Unifi now say:\nThis article is not applicable to the UniFi Dream Machine models, because all configurations are already available in the UniFi Network user interface.\nSo I take that to mean use of this file is depracated and it should be possible to do this via the administration webpage.\nChange network settings on Unifi controller Change network settings on Unifi controller Set the IGMP Proxy up Persist the IGMP Settings on Cloud Key What if it doesn't work? Further to getting my Unifi gear last year, I've started to organise the virtual local area networks (VLANs) to increase security. I've created a separate guest wifi network and a separate internet of things (IoT) network. One issue you'll run in to is that a lot of modern devices work by broadcasting their presence on the network and that doesn't work well normally across VLANs. None more so than Sonos, the home wireless speaker solution. Fortunately through trial and error with the help of Ubiquiti Forums - I've found a way to make it work.\nFirst we need to switch off optimise network in settings:\nThen in our network settings turn on IGMP snooping:\nSet the IGMP Proxy up Then we need to set up IGMP proxy on our Ubiquiti Security Gateway (USG). Log in (password you can check on Cloud Key, 192.168.1.1 should be your USG's IP address):\n$ ssh admin@192.168.1.1 Then on the USG console, we'll set upstream (our network with sonos controllers [for ex. iPhone, not on VLAN for me]) and downstream for the network with the Sonos hardware (for me VLAN 20 Play:1, Play:3 etc. etc.).\n$ configure $ edit protocols igmp-proxy $ set interface eth1 role upstream $ set interface eth1 threshold 1 $ set interface eth1.20 role downstream $ set interface eth1.20 threshold 1 The configuration can now be show with (also enter these commands on USG):\n$ show and should look like this (obviously 20 VLAN should reflect which VLAN your speakers are in!):\ninterface eth1 { role upstream threshold 1 } interface eth1.20 { role downstream threshold 1 } If that's all OK we should save and commit (which will restart the IGMP proxy):\n$ commit;save;exit Persist the IGMP Settings on Cloud Key Then we can test our controllers work and can contact the speakers. If that works great! But now we need to add the configuration to our Cloud Key, since the next time the Unifi Security Gateway is provisioned, our configuration will be erased. Also, there is currently no graphical options for IGMP proxy on the Cloud Key, so we'll need to use a custom config.gateway.json. We can dump our current configuration on our USG:\n$ mca-ctrl -t dump-cfg \u003e config.gateway.json then we need to edit it using vim to only contain our igmp section:\n$ vim config.gateway.json $ # Remove all the config except our IGMP proxy it should look like this, after you've finished editing it:\n{ \"protocols\": { \"igmp-proxy\": { \"interface\": { \"eth1\": { \"role\": \"upstream\", \"threshold\": \"1\" }, \"eth1.20\": { \"role\": \"downstream\", \"threshold\": \"1\" } } } } } if unsure, use https://jsonlint.com to double check syntax:\n$ cat config.gateway.json $ # Copy nand paste in to JSONlint to check Once we are happy our configuration is valid, let's copy it to our Cloud Key (replace 192.168.1.2 with your Cloud Key's IP address, password is your unifi account password with root user, check the unifi config path):\n$ scp config.gateway.json root@192.168.1.2:/usr/lib/unifi/data/sites/default/config.gateway.json Then run a force provision on the USG from the Cloud Key web interface and then check the config remains intact (replace 192.168.1.1 with your USG's IP address):\n$ ssh admin@192.168.1.1 $ configure $ edit protocols igmp-proxy $ show and should again look like this:\ninterface eth1 { role upstream threshold 1 } interface eth1.20 { role downstream threshold 1 } Congratulations! It works! Next step is to enable firewall rules to drop traffic you don't want crossing the VLANs to make them more secure. Check Sonos ports for examples on what to allow.\nWhat if it doesn't work? If it's not working, try these steps:\nCheck IP addresses of Sonos products (have they taken IP addresses in new VLAN?) Log on to the Cloud Key and try restart the IGMP proxy (forum reports of it crashing frequently on some people)\n$ ssh admin@192.168.1.1 $ configure $ edit protocols igmp-proxy $ show Try add a firewall rule (LAN IN) on the Cloud Key (which will provision to USG) to block all traffic from your VLAN to the other LAN/VLAN and turn logging on, can then check logs to see what traffic is allowed or denied on the USG:\n$ ssh admin@192.168.1.1 $ cat /var/log/messages | grep LAN_IN- this gives an idea of what device is trying to talk to what on what port.\n","description":"","tags":["networking","homenet"],"title":"Ubiquiti Unifi with Sonos on a separate VLAN","uri":"/ubnt-sonos/"},{"content":"Ubuntu have recently released the new 20.04 LTS codenamed “Focal Fossa”. I’d also recently seen a tool that piqued my interest, Hashicorp Packer. Packer builds machine images that can be deployed to a cloud or as a virtual machine, or just even a plain disk image. You can even generate many images at once, really simplfying deployment. Very handy if you wanted to create virtual machines for a cluster for example, with a similar but slightly different configuration.\nI decided to take Packer for a spin and try create a virtual machine image for Virtualbox/Vagrant that can easily be spun up for any project. Firstly you’ll need to install Virtualbox and then Vagrant on your machine.

Ubiquiti do business Wifi, all the way up to covering stadiums. I first heard about them from Troy Hunt and then again from Marco Arment on Accidental Tech Podcast. Ubiquiti are popular in prosumer space - for people serious about good Wifi.\nSo far it’s been an excellent experience and I’d highly recommend it. After setting it up (there is a few moving pieces) it has been running without any intervention from me. Being a professional product, it’s not just a home router (with inbuilt wifi), there is a few more pieces you need to buy:\nGateway - this connects to your home router, and serves as an access point (approx. €120) Switch - this is to distribute the internet from the gateway to all other devices (approx. €105) [plugs in to Gateway] Cloud Key - this is the management ‘computer’ that gives you a web control panel to control all the Ubiquiti gear (approx. €85) [plugs in to Switch] Wireless Access point - this is the ‘Antenna’ which actually gives you wifi (approx. €90) [plugs in to Switch] Basic connection diagram would be like this:\nYour ISP Modem ∧ | ∨ Gateway ∧ | ∨ Switch \u003c-\u003e Cloud Key ∧ | | |-\u003e Any other Wired Devices ∨ Access Point ∧ | ∨ Your Wifi Devices This is the basic Ubiquiti setup, you need to purchase at least 4 devices to give you Wifi. So at this point, you may think it’s all expensive and you’d be right. For the 4 devices, you are looking at at least €400 outlay - which is much more expensive then even the high-end Wifi routers from Netgear etc.\nThe big advantage is: expandability and ease of control. The Ubiquiti dashboard is highly configurable, you can search for Wifi channels which the neighbours aren’t using. Also, if you have dead spots in your house, no problem, just buy another Wireless Access Point and plug it in: job done!\nAnother big advantage for me, if I change internet service provider, I just plug a new modem in to my gateway. Nothing changes (like IP addresses) for my local devices. Also, you could configure Ubiquiti gateway to have two connections (like cable modem and 4G modem connected) and load balance or fail-over between them - but I haven’t gone that crazy (yet!). Also, if a new standard of Wifi comes? Just pop on another access point.\nOverall I’m very happy with the setup. It feels like an investment that you get payback over time on, so I’m looking forward to being able to manage my network much easier and incrementally upgrade over time with much less hassle.\n","description":"","tags":["networking,","homenet"],"title":"Ubiquiti Home Network","uri":"/ubnt/"},{"content":"In a previous post, I mentioned importing transactions using ledger/hledger and plain text accounting. As my former bank PTSB recently raised their fees, I decided to move to KBC. I was excited to see, as part of the open payments directive, they have a nice developer portal. I reached out to KBC’s dev team, but alas they are only accepting registered companies, who meet stringent criteria. They told me they hope to open it up soon to end users, I live in hope!\nAnother piece of bad news is that KBC online banking has no way to download transactions! Also I couldn’t re-use my previous python script as KBC make heavy use of two-factor authentication, meaning I’d have to enter a code anyway. Plus I could rework the script, only to get access to the proper API and have to do it again.

As the name suggests, you install it on a raspberry pi. I left it in situ for about a month, until I decided I wanted to swap out the pi, but keep PiHole.\nThe natural solution to this, is to use a docker container. Rather helpfully, there is a publicly available docker build of PiHole. Simple, right? Well my home network is also IPv6, thus the DNS on the raspberrypi should be also. The problem is, Docker has support for IPv6, but it’s not very straightforward with Docker Compose.\nAfter a lot of fiddling about, I finally managed it. As per the Docker IPv6 documentation, on Linux (I used Ubuntu Server) you need to add a configuration file to enable IPv6, at /etc/docker/daemon.json:\n{ \"ipv6\": true, \"fixed-cidr-v6\": \"2001:db8:1::/64\" } Then you need to restart Docker daemon:\n$ sudo systemctl restart docker\nthat will allow the new daemon.json file to take effect.\nAfter this, I had an existing setup with Plex and other things already controlled by docker-compose. The solution here is to kill all your containers and recreate the compose network by hand with IPv6 subnet:\n$ cd \u003cmy_compose_dir\u003e $ docker network ls # name of compose network should have directory name in it $ docker network inspect \u003ccompose_net_name\u003e # Make note of exisiting IPv4 Subnet/Gateway $ docker-compose kill # Kill all your existing containers $ docker network prune # Remove/Prune the network (as no more containers are attached) $ docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 --gateway=172.18.0.1 --ipv6 --subnet=2001:db8:2::/64 \u003ccompose_net_name\u003e and lastly for the piece de resistance, let’s bring up our compose containers:\n$ docker-compose up -d\nnow we can also verify we get IPv6 working internally (see this helpful post here):\n$ docker run -itd ajeetraina/ubuntu-iproute bash # Start first container $ docker run -itd ajeetraina/centos-iproute bash # Start second container (new terminal) In both containers you can run:\n$ ifconfig eth0\nwhich will show you the IPv6 address of each.

I only ever found one two problems:\nTime - Life eh? It's a mode of Emacs for which I'd also have to learn (again time) So I recently set about solving both shortcomings, as painful as it was to dismiss all the effort I put in to my vim muscle memory over the years. The tough part usually is finding good documentation that is both easy to read and follow.\nSo what is org-mode? To put it simply, Org-mode is an editing mode of Emacs, which allows you to write plain text TODO lists. But it is also a lot more. You can:\nUse plain text tables Run snippets of code (and edit them in their own file with proper formatting) Use plain text spreadsheets Export to many, many formats (Latex, PDF, HTML) or a custom format Agenda mode for many ways to look at your TODOs This all sounds complicated, but the beautiful thing about org-mode is that it gradually reveals the features it has. You can only ever write a simple list like this if you want:\n* My First org mode outline ** TODO Must read the org manual and that's it. Really. You don't need to use any of the other features if you don't want to. This is also a reason that it was a joy to learn: it never pushes unnecessary complication on the user. I wish I could say the same for Emacs! Although to be fair, Emacs is probably easier then Vim to get started in.\n## Combining Emacs + Org: Literate Programming\nSo this was the fun part: how can I combine learning Emacs and Org? It turns out, I can create my whole Emacs configuration file in org-mode, and it will convert it Emacs Lisp. This is brilliant because in org-mode, we can annotate and explain everything. Take a look at this:\n* Packages Let's fetch Emacs packages from the Melpa mirror: #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"https://melpa.org/packages/\")) #+END_SRC This is fully self documented code (some argue Lisp is this by nature also). This is nicely rendered on Github, see these two examples to see what I mean. The pertinent advice here is: start with a minimal configuration and only ever add things you understand. I followed exactly this advice, and those two files were brilliant references. I would find an annoyance in Emacs, and one of those two org files would have something in Emacs to fix customise the issue I had.\nIf you would like to see more, my dotfiles (with my Emacs config are available also.\n","description":"","tags":["emacs"],"title":"Learning Org Mode","uri":"/org-mode/"},{"content":"Over the last while I’ve been collecting wonderful podcast episodes from the hundreds of hours I’ve listened to.

I’ve used Docker Compose to bring up a Plex Docker container, with:\nFilebot (to tag video files) Beets (to tag audio files) Transmission (to download files) Webhook (receives incoming web requests) The way it works is this:\nFrom my phone or tablet, I send a web request to webhook container with details of the download (using Workflow) Webhook then calls Transmission, and Transmission starts downloading When the download is finished, it is put in a folder so either Beets or Filebot can access it. They then tag the download and move it to the correct folder for Plex. I get sent a notification and I’ll manually update the Plex library.

Then I got requests to post this data to the correct endpoint (just like a browser does). At first this didn’t work, and then I remembered that it could have a CSRF token. When I checked the HTML source, sure enough it did, so I created a function to strip this out and I also sent this with the data. Success! I got to the second login page…\nAfter this was my pin code, but the bank only asks for digits. I simply put my pin in an array and scraped the digits needed, all minused by 1 (since arrays are 0-indexed). I posted this data the exact same way as before. Next I was in! I could display all my balance info.\nThe last step was to get the transactions. This proved a bit tricky also since my bank has a download button that’s in flash for the Excel file. I was a bit stumped until I noticed they used an open source program called data tables. In data tables all the fields are nicely marked with what data they contain (be it date, description, money in, money out, etc. etc). I used Beautiful Soup to grab this data, and then finally write it to a CSV file. I was quite happy with the script, and how fast I could pull it together in python!\nWarning: The code below is just to show how it could be done, and was written in a hurry to get a job done.

Naturally enough, I ported the Ruby code I wrote, and it now posts the menu every day to our Slack channel.\nThis also got me thinking of what other information would be handy to have. I scouted around for ideas and came up with an obvious one: reminder of the bus times to and from the office.

There are a lot of solutions on the web for this, but most of them are very complex. I stumbled across this easy method of using the authorized_keys file, simply add command=\"ls -l\" (replacing ls -l with something a bit more useful like tmux or screen) in front of the key fingerprint. This also means you can have different commands for different keys if you choose.\nExample authorized_keys file:\ncommand=\"tmux a -t \u003cmysessionname\u003e\" ssh-rsa AAAAB3... A lot of the other solutions you’ll find on the web recommend editing profile, bashrc, ssh_config or some other important shell files - something you should avoid unless absolutely necessary. One more word of advice, make sure the command will always execute sucessfully. If the command fails for any reason (like a Tmux session not existing) your SSH connection will close, since this is the command that will keep it open. That’s fine if you have access to the computer and have a screen attached to fix it, but if you are remote then you will be out of luck.\nIf you enjoyed this post, you should check out my post on using patterns in SSH config file.\n","description":"","tags":["terminal","secure-shell"],"title":"Run Command on SSH Login","uri":"/ssh-login-cmd/"},{"content":"I’m a big fan of the shell and the productivity it brings, you can have a text editor, command to run a server and more within easy reach. I use a shell at work, at home and on the go. On the go could be using my iPad or iPhone. One of the first SSH clients on iOS was iSSH, which I used many years ago. After this, Panic released a professional class application called Prompt. Prompt is what I’ve happily used for the last few years, but the 10 minute background process limit is a constant pain. Just a quick switch away for a few minutes, and you have to reconnect. That’s fine once or twice, but when it happens many times it seriously slows your productivity.\nOf course an obvious solution to this is something like GNU Screen or Tmux. I’ve also used Tmux for the last few years and I’ve found it indispensible to working remotely on my iPad, to try get any sort of programming done. While I love Prompt, and it is a very well designed app, I couldn’t get much done on the go on my home machine over SSH.\nThat is until I rediscovered Mosh. Mosh is an MIT project that redesigns the shell for the 21st Century (unreliable mobile internet connections). I’d seen this project a few years back, but it had no mobile (Android or iOS) client at that stage and was purely experimental. It now has very wide platform support, including a new(-ish) iOS app called Blink. The major benefit of mosh is that it doesn’t need root to install, uses existing SSH connections to set itself up and doesn’t need a constant connection. This differs hugely from Prompt in terms of usability, no more 10 minute session timeouts, you reconnect instantly using a very efficient UDP protocol Mosh uses (on a port between 60,000-61,000). It all just feels very effortless.\nThat said, there are still issues around scrollback buffer and connecting to multiple sessions with Tmux. Scrollback sometimes gets garbled with Mosh/Blink, and it is a known issue of Mosh. Also Tmux sizes itself based on the client which connects, which is fine if you connect with one device. Connect with multiple devices of different resolutions (phone, tablet, laptop) and you’ll see wasted space abound. So while the potential of Mosh is still great, I still feel it is in the early adopter phase. If you like the future and can handle the rough edges, definitely give it a shot.\n","description":"","tags":["terminal","ios","review","secure-shell"],"title":"iOS Shells, Prompt vs. Mosh","uri":"/mosh/"},{"content":"For the last few years, I’ve always wanted to budget properly and see where my money was going. But like all habits that are good for you, looking after your finances takes time, care and attention. I started off by researching the market for budgeting software. A lot of the prepackged software out there was very US-centric, including Quicken, Microsoft Money and Mint.com. I eventually settled on and bought a license for You Need a Budget, because: it had a budgeting methodology, very good Euro support and was cross platform with Adobe Air. YNAB lasted me well for a few years, with its pretty graphs and ease of expense entry. I even liked their much pared-down companion iOS app at the time.\nFast forward to a few months ago, I decided I needed to get back on the budgeting horse, so to speak. I had a look at YNAB, expecting a major new version but instead was greeted with a cloud service. Although I love cloud services, I don’t appreciate a third party which is not my bank having my financial information, because every major company, even ones the size of Yahoo, get hacked eventually. I then tried an iOS application called iBank, which retrieves your bank statements automatically by logging in to your bank on your behalf. But this again crosses the line on security and privacy, so I was out of luck.\nThat is until I found plain text accounting and the programs ledger and hledger. These two programs are command line applications, which read a plain text file filled with your transactions, like this:\n2016-10-10 Two Euro Shop ; Shouldn't buy this cheap stuff again Expenses:Knicknacks €2 Assets:Checking -€2 Each transaction is as simple as the one above and is compatible between the two programs. There’s no prefined accounts (like Expenses:Knicknacks or Assets:Checking), you can put whatever makes sense to you and the categories will exist. Anything prefixed with semicolon (;) is a comment, which is handy for searching the file and the date (2016-10-10) well obviously, it’s a date! The only thing you have to make sure of is that the transaction balances, so the €2 and -€2 have to equal 0.\nSo at this point it looked good, but I had four major questions:\nHow do I get data in? How do I start with incomplete data? How do I budget? What can I use on iOS? So getting to the first question, it’s very easy thankfully, but this is where we bring in the second program, hledger. Hledger is compatible with ledger, but with a few nice bells and whistles on top. One of these is extra nice CSV support, so you can download CSV files and import them. All CSV files are different, so how do we make sure we get the right data in? Use rules files, which are a hledger concept. Stick a .rules file named the same as your .csv file:\n$ ls Transaction_export.csv.rules Transaction_export.csv These .rules file are fairly simple:\n#Skip the first few lines skip 2 #these are fields to match the csv, including skipping fields fields date, description, , amount-in, amount-out if McDonalds account2 Expenses:Restaurants Then we can print the transactions with hledger -f Transaction_export.csv print which will show us what would be produced (like the transaction above for the €2 shop). Simply tweak the rules file to match retailers, banks, restaurants etc you use and then append the result to your budget file: hledger -f Transaction_export.csv print \u003e\u003e .hledger.journal. Simply wash and repeat every few days, once you have enough transactions.\nNext, starting with incomplete data is inevitable, I’m not going to remember every transaction before I started to pay attention! But this problem is easy to solve, create a balancing transaction at the top of your budget file, dated before your first transaction you started with, like so:\n2016-10-09 * Opening Balance Current Account ; Just started budgeting! Assets:Checking €2 Equity:Opening Balances -€2 You’ll know this is successful if the balance command actually reflects your account balance in real life: ledger -f ~/.hledger.journal balance.\nAfter this, your accounts are all set up and you have your transactions, so why all this pain again? Oh yes - budgeting! There are many ways to do this, such as shadow accounts etc that I won’t cover, please have a look on Plain Text Accounting for some more advice on this. I’ll cover my preffered method, a set budget every month, which you can check the balance of. At the top of my file I simply have something like this:\n~ Monthly Expenses:Restaurants €15 Expenses:Entertainment €30 Expenses:Car Tolls €0 Then we can just issue one command to see the the status of each category: ledger -p \"this month\" --budget --monthly balance ^expenses, I have this aliased to “budget” as a command, which shows if we are on target or have overspent this month on any category we like.\nIf your on a mobile device, unless you use an SSH program to a central server, plain text accounting can be hard to use. My solution is to use the budgets above and reflect them in the brilliant Pennies app. Pennies is lightweight and doesn’t want transactions really, it wants a different budget for each category you need. This way you can see if you’ve gone over or under every month in any category you want. So you don’t have to enter correct data, just data with the right amounts, which is easy to get from ledger. That way when you feel an impulse purchase coming on, you can check Pennies and remind yourself your budget is more important!\n","description":"","tags":["software","review"],"title":"Plain Text Accounting","uri":"/ledger/"},{"content":"As part of my masters degree in University College Dublin, we undertook a group project which focused on building a technology product. I’m very proud about how we ran the project, so I’d like to give an overview of it here! The product is a technology news application, which personalised your news feed based on your interests. I like to think of it as Facebook meets Techmeme meets your favourite RSS news feeds!\nThe Project The theme was “News in the 21st Century” and we were supplied with a copy of the BBC’s the “Future of News” report. Each team (there were 10), had to go away and think of how they could tackle this theme with a technological slant. We also had constraints that we needed to develop in an agile manner and to prove we could try to be a real viable startup, with cost and salary estimates as well as a way to make money on our project.\nThe team There was 5 in our team , out of a class of ~50. Only our group and one other (~about 8 people) were employed full time. The other groups were full time students. We did the whole project working remotely, while holding down our usual busy schedules. We started by dividing out the roles in to Project Manager (Larry), Business Manager (Kevin), Communications Lead (Garry), Software Engineering Lead (me) and Software developer (Igor).\nGetting Started So in June 2015, we had our roles set, we just needed to think about what we would actually do! I’m a big fan of technology news, so it was my idea that won the day: to base our application on technology news. We knew intrinsically that we would have to keep the scope really narrow, due to the 3 month window we had to ship. We started having really frequent meetings on Skype/Google Hangouts, started making sprints in Trello, and chatted about issues in Slack.\nMid-term presentation By June 30th, less then 20 days in, we needed to have a working prototype, with basic functionality. I had started to use Docker and was very familiar with continuous delivery from my job in Ericsson. So I developed our first prototype, then showed it to the guys and had to get buy in. We had a bumpy ride at the start, getting everyone on the same page and setup correctly, as we had various different personal machines. For the midterm presentation we had to have mockups, project plan, business plan and a high level view of all our our sprints. Here’s our midterm presentation (download here):\nFinal presentation For the final presentation in August, we were under lots of pressure. We didn’t have time to get various production elements we would have liked: such as more comprehensive automated test, a fancier design (none of us were user interface experts) and just generally more fit and finish. Here’s the final presentation we made (you can download it here)\nAt the end, we got an A+. When we got the marking sheet back, the highest levels of praise were reserved for our method of production, we took the project very seriously and made sure we paid attention to how we worked together and the system of delivery. We were agile enough to be able to stick to our overall goals, but still tweak and drop ideas which didn’t work out in reality. Overall I was exteremely proud of it and I think the two main presentations we made are a great overview of the work we did as a team.\n","description":"","tags":["education"],"title":"Newsfast MSc Project in UCD","uri":"/newsfast/"},{"content":"If you haven’t tried Google Apps Script, I found a really nifty use for it: smart filtering for email.

This book is really a case study in why the future of work will be remote, of which the book did convince me (but I would say, I already believed).\nThe book is really structured to convince those who do not believe in the premise of the title. It talks about many successful companies who have transformed themselves to work remotely fully and large corporations who save lots of money on office space (IBM, being one example).\nThe biggest criticism I would have is that the book is simply too positive. It brushes over negatives, if it really ever discussed any (I came away not remembering any one overtly negative point). Also, the book never tackles what the future of remote working really will be, i.e. how it can be better. Some of the downsides of remote working (isolation being the major one) can be tackled with the help of technology, but the book never explores this point (in fairness it could be the topic of a book in and of itself). That would have made this a lot more interesting read!\nOverall I would give this book to skeptics, but I would expect them to believe very little of it (or how it could apply to them, if your not IBM or a cool hip startup).

The Code Keyboards are designed by Jeff Atwood (who founded Stack Overflow). Mechanical keyboards are “old style” in that the switches are from an era where everything was mechanical, unlike today where everything is glass. So mechanical keyboards have ardent fans and people who don’t really care for them.\nI did a lot of research before I purchased, talking to various people in work who are very knowledgeable about mechanical keyboards (The best community for advice, discussion and group buys is /r/mechanicalkeyboards on reddit.). The variety of hardware and opinions is positively mind melting. If you are doing your own research, you should definitely come across Cherry switches (a very established German brand). Switches are what sit between your key that you see (with the letter printed on top) and the electronic board that converts the key press to a signal the computer can understand.\nAnother big brand in the mechanical world is Ducky, a Taiwanese company who make predominantly mechanical keyboards. They are known for their quality and the variety (lights, amount of keys [102, 104] etc). For my part, I decided on not buying a big brand like Ducky or Das Keyboard, but to go with the Code Keyboard, as this matched what I wanted.\nWhile searching I decided on factors to suit me:\nNo fancy light displays Should be backlit Compact size Should look professional No fancy non-standard media keys ( I want it to work with any computer out of the box). Shouldn’t be too noisy (I respect my colleagues right to peace and quiet!!!) The Code Keyboard matched all of these. Over a year later I’m very happy with them still, I would recommend them.

My first impression was how expensive it was priced and what really makes a premium writing application?\nNeedless to say, I’m not a huge writer. But I do have a real fondness for plain text (it will survive the apocalypse) and by extension, Markdown by John Gruber. The problem for Ulysses is this: there’s lots of really great Markdown applications for iOS, two of which I have written about: Editorial (my favourite) and Byword (not so keen on this app).\nSo where does that leave Ulysses? Well John Voorhees wrote an excellent column in Club Macstories Newsletter, where he said you need to exploit a niche on the App Store, but it needs to not be a niche of one (aka. just you). So Ulysses is different to the other applicants I mentioned in key ways:\nAll files are called “Sheets” and by default do not need a file name, it is kind of like Drafts, just open and write away It has a library, all optionally but by default synced to iCloud It has filters, which are flexible way to quickly group “sheets” It has extensive tagging It has optional word count targets for each “sheet” You can add notes and other metadata which will not show up in the exported result (usually PDF) It supports many formats for export, such as docx, PDF, HTML, ePub It is very themeable, with an online web gallery of themes So in other words, it’s a lot more extensive in different features and thus audience to the other editors.\nSo would I recommend it? I’m still not sure about the desktop class application tag the developers have used, but it is a nice app to write in (I wrote this post on my iPhone in Ulysses). The library and filters seem like something I may not truly need, but there’s no doubt it’s a nicely designed app. Overall for me it’s probably not worth the price tag as I wouldn’t use key features, but if your serious about writing, you should definitely pick it up.\n","description":"","tags":["ios","review"],"title":"Ulysses App","uri":"/ulysses-app/"},{"content":"I backed the Roost laptop stand on Kickstarter, which already had a successful run in their first Kickstarter campaign.

Here’s what a sample Dashing dashboard looks like:\nIt’s been a huge success, but it was tough to gain traction along the way. Here I’ll summarise what I’ve learned (in no particular order):\nDon’t do dashboards for managers, do them for teams Use big text, have the minimum information as required Use colours (preferably like the traffic light system) to focus attention Link in all critical systems to daily work Make it a one stop shop and faster then all other methods of getting this information Reuse the work of others (steal with pride) Don’t bother with graphs Below I outline the reasons for each point:\nDon’t do them for managers Teams want statistics to help them do their job better, not as a metric to be hit with like a stick. You have to assure the team the goal is to help them do their jobs better and to focus on the important things. Metrics don’t explain nuances, so the team lead/scrum master needs to take this and let the team get back to whats important - development.\nUse BIG text With Dashing, it’s very easy to create widgets from scratch and pack a lot of information in. You have to fight this urge, use trial and error and see what the teams respond to. Constant tweaking is the name of the game and listen to the suggestions of others. While you can’t and shouldn’t listen to everyone, try see if their idea could work in a slightly altered form.\nUse Colours The best colours are the traffic light system. People don’t need to be techinical to know, green=good, orange=warning, red=danger. It also helps focus on what I should be looking at. Red is most critical, so my attention should on that first and so on. Use the limits sparingly at first (ie. don’t have everything red or orange, or no one will pay attention) and tweak as you go.\nLink in all critical systems Everything I need to know should be on the dashboard, and that means for us a lot of disparate systems. Luckily a lot of products have an API these days and it’s very easy to link Dashing to any system, thanks to the flexibility of Ruby. We have linked:\nJenkins: for status of all our release jobs, server status etc Gerrit: for number of code reviews, so make sure to keep on top of them A custom maintrack solution, so we know the latest version of software and whether we can deliver Jira, for the number of bugs Last tested version of our software on the main track Make it a one stop shop People will use tools that make their lives easier. The trouble is, when you start, that won’t be evident. You’ve got to keep on top of what people like and respond to. People often have ideas/tweaks after I’ve added something new, as they see what can be done. You should distill down to exactly what your team needs, no more, no less. This pure trial and error and you have to be ruthless in cutting things that don’t work. Space is valuable, your teams attention is valuable, so don’t waste either.\nSteal with pride The “Additional Widgets” wiki page for dashing has lots and lots of premade widgets, use them! Often I have to make tweaks, but the majority of the hard work is done. You can browse widgets by service (like Jira or Confluence, there’s a few for each), or browse the list in general and see if a widget with a totally different purpose (say bus times) could be repurposed in to a list of the last commits by time, etc!\nDon’t bother with graphs Management love graphs, but development teams don’t. Burndowns for example, are a step above where your focus should be. You need to have servers ready, bugs in check, maintrack to be open for deliveries, all before you have a hope of burning down. This will different for every team, but I’d steer clear of graphs, comics, funny pictures etc, they are not conducive to work and are very hard to read from a distance.\n","description":"","tags":["ruby"],"title":"Dashing Dashboards","uri":"/dashing/"},{"content":"Continuing the theme of automation, one of the most repetitive tasks if you work for a big company is timesheets.

It’s one of those technologies where when you start to use it, you immediately know it’s going to be a sea change in how things are done in the industry. It’s definitely going to be more impactful then Virtual Machines.\nWe’ve used Docker to great effect where I work. We’re building a huge system called Ericsson Network Manager, which will manage the networks of the future. As such, it’s a hugely complex problem to compartmentalise parts of the product, to be able to just use the part that you work directly on.\nThere has been two approaches inside the company:\nEncapsulate the whole system Just encapsulate the product In my product area, we’ve focused on number 2. We did this because we wanted to focus on two things:\nAutomated functional testing Automated integration testing And again, number 2 was the main catalyst, as the existing infrastructure we had in place was very compromised. We have a central Continuous Integration service, but with over 100 teams, they can’t suit every team and every product.\nSo we decided to start small and just have Docker prove itself by taking over parts of our infrastructure where we ran integration tests. We have had many issues, but they have been mostly with the immaturity of Docker, for which Docker hasn’t provided a centralised solution (like cleaning up unused images, which can fill up a whole disk and then bad things happen). Elsewhere companies like Spotify and Google have written custom solutions to many of these such issues.\nThe biggest advantages we’ve gotten have been:\nExperience with Docker A cleaner deployment for local development Much more reliable and predictable integration tests Less work to do with local deployment Disadvantages:\nMore infrastructure that’s not core to the product More to learn (some people can be resistant to new technology!) More maintenance when things go wrong Overall for us as a product area I think Docker has been a worthwhile investment for sure. It’s definitely not as stable as Virtual Machines (which at this point is very old technology), but the possibilities it brings to speed up development and deployment are really exciting to me!\n","description":"","tags":["docker","work"],"title":"Adventures with Docker","uri":"/docker/"},{"content":"Deliveries helps you track packages from major shopping (Amazon, Apple) as well as nearly every major package distribution company like DHL, UPS and FedEx.

I haven’t done much with JavaScript, apart from a course in work, which was focused on the language itself and jQuery. React is a front end framework, which allows you to build reusable components (and generate them with data.)\nThe only real experience I have is writing an application (using Node.js) for my MSc course which was an AJAX application for interacting with Amazon SimpleDB. It was fun to write and weird that I could use the same language from the front-end to the back-end.\nBack to the React course, I completed it over a week, taking my time to break things (it’s the only way to get an appreciation for how things work!). It’s a really nicely laid out course, where you build a market for fish (a lot more exciting then it sounds). It doesn’t really cover any CSS or HTML, so you should at least know that before starting.\nWhat I really liked in particular was the build tools, including Gulp. Gulp is like Make, Maven, Gradle, Ant etc. It’s very flexible and fast, with hundreds of modules on Node Package Manager to choose from. Part of building the app, you can make the assets (HTML+CSS etc) smaller (minification), run a web server and open your browser with the app automatically. Combined with a nifty tool called BrowserSync, it’s the fastest feedback cycle I’ve probably ever had. That makes it fantastic if your new to this kind of thing, nothing inspires happiness more than seeing instant results!\nAlso the course does a pretty good job at taking you from today’s JavaScript standard (ES5) to the more modern equivalents (ES6, ES7). JavaScript in time is set to become a much nicer language to write, the only problem is compatibility. Luckily the course touches on Babel which happily transpiles all your fancy newer JavaScript down the widely supported standard of ES5. The compatibility will probably be painful, it always is - judging by Python (2 to 3), Perl and all the other languages which have sought to remove cruft.\nAll in all I’d very much recommend it.

Is this section too verbose or did we make it too complex for the customer? Should we explain ancillary parts of our system (either operating system components or other applications?) within our documentation besides the inherent risks (out-of-date documentation)?\nThese are all tough questions, but the important part is: it makes you stop and think. This not only applies to your customer facing documents, but internal documentation. In my job I am mostly the one who updates the “New Starts” section of our internal documentation.

I believe it saves the new person and myself countless hours of often trivial questions. Of course I always happily answer (and enjoy answering) the tough questions also.

Recognising the need to keep things simple, have a short and easy to comprehend manual goes a long way to keeping customers loyal. I’ve been told that the biggest complaint received is poor documentation and we’re lucky that our customers are very forthright and vocal. Good documentation is understandably hard to do, time consuming and easy to sweep aside due to time and cost pressures.

I then tried to search for a third party podcast application on the iPad that would synchronise with Google Reader. First there were none, then some (like Feedler and Instacast) but all have been bitterly disappointing with Google Reader integration. Instacast could import OPML (after a messy bundling of feeds in Google Reader) and Feedler could read the feeds (but not handle the video and audio contained within the feed item properly).

But - happily - I was wrong and had been looking in the wrong places…\nI’d never heard of Stitcher before, but to my surprise it has all the features I needed: position and read status syncing across all platforms. By all platforms I mean the most important - PC (web version), Android and iOS (iPhone/iPad). It also has a great auto-playlist feature that works on recommendations. If you’re a music fan like me who has used these type of services for years (auto playlists) and have always been bitterly disappointed (like I have been) - fear not, I’ve used it and it actually works.

I am fascinated by living tied to the web, indeed my honours computer science thesis deals with this in relation to mobile applications (and hybrid half-app/ half-website). Spurred on by the excellent reviews this Chromebook has gotten (\"It’s $1,000 worth of design made with $100 worth of materials\" - The Verge and “You simply won’t find a netbook this nice for that little money.” - Engadget).\nI’m typing this review on the laptop now and it’s keyboard is the first thing that is noticeably good. As good as my MacBook Pro that cost 10x as much (bar the lack of a back-light which I miss). The design is clearly inspired by the Macbook Air - it is light and very portable. Battery life is also good, 6.5-7 hours in most reviews. Also it’s fan-less and I have been unable to make it get hot (unlike almost every other laptop I have owned). I’m a heavy Google user (been using Docs since 2007, Calendar since 2006 and Gmail since 2004) so the promise of the apps I use most being on the Chromebook was a non-issue. I’m also a very lackadaisical gamer, I’ll happily go a long time without a proper console/pc game and fill the void with 5 minutes of cut the rope or Angry Birds (and these are better on my smartphone then in Chrome).\nI also use a lot of web services. I’ve gone out of my way to put files on Google Drive when I knew I was buying this machine. I’ve already used Picasa for years and uploaded my music to Google Music recently. I use Evernote for notes (their web version is flaky offline though, hopefully this will be fixed). I’m trying my best to stick to this laptop for all personal use. My work laptop is a Windows machine, but I spend almost all of my time in a Linux remote desktop and in Chrome. That brings me to one thing I miss and that is a proper IDE. I’ve researched the web versions and frankly they are pretty bad. I do see promise though - having it all managed would be a great asset - I’ve seen countless people struggle with IDE issues.\nMy struggle with this laptop is where it fits (between desktop, power laptop, smartphone, tablet etc). For the first time a generation who could almost entirely survive on touch interfaces is growing up - so it’s no wonder Microsoft is positioning the Surface for the office of the future - people will expect, nay demand some sort of touch. The issue is whether ChromeOS (which almost certainly will merge the divide and bring out a touch laptop) can win this space with just web apps. This has almost made me feel old in technology terms. Don’t get me wrong - I love touch. But I also love my keyboard for coding, you can pry it from my cold dead hands. I’m also not getting rid of my MacBook Pro, I still need that safety cushion of proper computer. I feel the same way about my desktop - I like sitting down at a computer and experiencing comfort!\nBut I realise I own too many devices. I like cloud computing because it also means I can have low-powered, cheap devices and not have to worry about backup. ChromeOS extends this so the laptop updates automatically every six weeks. So how can I trim the fat? I’m not sure… I’ll report back with more findings from sticking to just ChromeOS in a later post - stay tuned!\n","description":"","tags":["google","review"],"title":"First Experiences with an ARM Chromebook","uri":"/first-experiences-with-arm-chromebook/"},{"content":"Lately both Google and Microsoft have been advertising their respective browsers on British Television (received in Ireland by the vast majority of the population).

I know I write mainly technology articles, but I thought a departure was warranted from the usual faire.\nMy main takeaway from having it done is twofold: it’s not as bad as you think and it’s as bad as you think. They seem like contradictory statements, so I’ll need to explain myself right? Okay.\nNot as bad… Firstly it’s not as bad as you think because everyone on the Internet exaggerates. If your like me - you’ve spent countless hours researching and reading the experiences of others. That’s a very bad idea for one of the most common surgeries performed in the world today - overwhelmingly most of the experiences will be rare cases (bleeding, extreme pain etc) because people like to tell horror stories. I can’t explain that facet of human psychology but I can say this: statistically speaking you’ll be extremely unlucky not to be in the bunch of people who do just fine after the surgery.\nAs bad as you think… It’s as bad as you think because these things aren’t a walk in the park. I almost gasped when the surgeon told me I’d need two weeks off work. Two weeks? Two weeks?!? It turns out all those years of medical training means he’s actually right! You’re going to experience a lot of swelling and pain and there’s very little you can do but take the pain-killers and anti-inflammatory medication and hope they work. You’ll sound ridiculous, people will find you hard to understand (and will find it hard to empathise because you’ll be grumpy through sheer frustration with eating and a horrible diet). You’ll also probably get a very erratic sleep pattern and feel tired from that and the medication. It’s no cake walk and at times you feel very frustrated with yourself for imposing this burden on your life (why did I choose to have this operation?!?!).\nWhy I got a tonsillectomy The back story as to why I got the operation is I had tonsillitis for two and a half months straight, yes two and a half months! I’d lost count of the painkillers and antibiotics I’d taken in that period, but it’s safe to say in 90% of that timeframe I was taking pills daily to stave off illness. It worked, I wasn’t sick from tonsillitis when I was taking the medication, but I did get sick from the medication itself and I lost a whole lot of weight (with my friends commenting on how thin I’d gotten). I also felt tired all of the time from the antibiotics - I could never get enough sleep to offset this. In fact I was almost as physically drained when I was not on the medication and just suffering from tonsillitis. This is clearly no way to live and my GP agreed and so a consultation was arranged which led to the surgery.\nBreakdown by day Day 0 Saturday - Day of the operation. Surgery is quick, I was wheeled in approx. 9:30am and woke at 11am in recovery. I was given morphine during the surgery so the first day was absolutely pain free. I tried to eat but got sick due to the morphine, so I was given anti-nausea medication. I ate toast and drank tea (which I was later told the tea was a mistake, cold drinks only)\nDay 1 Sunday - Day after the operation, I was discharged from hospital around 11am. I had been taking diphene1 twice a day, using Solpadol2 as required (got a prescription for these two medications). Also lots of water and Ice, ice, ice.\nDay 2-4 Monday-Thursday - Little to no pain, took medication as directed and sucked on ice every waking minute it felt like. Stayed with family as directed in case of bleeding (mandated by the surgeon). Scabs starting to form. Diet mostly liquid. Found dairy bad for mucus (hindering speech) so decided to almost cut it out completely. Slept about 12 hours a day.\nDay 5-11 Friday-Wednesday - Pain starts to really bite, as I start to eat more then liquids and the scabbing gets intense. The smell from your throat is wickedly bad, try chew gum! Sleep goes totally AWOL, still probably sleeping 12 hours a day but in pieces due to the pain and constant need for liquidation of the throat. I ran out of medication the Wednesday, luckily a quick call to the hospital and a repeat prescription is issued by fax to a local pharmacy (phew).\nDay 12 Onwards - Taking the medication as directed so no real pain. Around day 18 I’m forgetting I ever had them removed, the only time I remember is in work when I I forget to drink water for a period and my thorat is dry. If you suffer from dry throat (I don’t, I drink a lot I think normally throughout a day) I’m sure you’d describe this like any other dry throat.\nI’m having a follow up visit which will be four weeks almost to the day after the operation soon - I don’t expect any surprises, it’s healing really well and I have forgotten at this stage the pain even!\nDiphene is a pain-killer and anti-inflammatory. Taken twice a day in my case, I found it indispensable for the very bad swelling I had. ↩︎\nSoloadol is also a painkiller and anti-inflammatory. Paracetamol and codeine-based, it’s the pain killer taken throughout the day. I found it particularly useful before stressful events like eating to offset pain before it will occur. ↩︎\n","description":"","tags":["health"],"title":"Tonsillectomy","uri":"/tonsillectomy/"},{"content":"I’ve seen an article by Miguel de Icaza, a great developer oft criticised for his love of Microsoft technologies on Linux. His latest piece is about his love for Mac OS X as a desktop and how he used to feel guilty about it (given his very impressive open source credentials).\nI used to feel the same also. Android even as a platform more closely follows my ideals, yet I am exclusively an avid iOS user at this point. But as I’ve learned more, the importance of pragmatism is clear. I use my personal iOS devices for countless hours a day and I really just want them to work. I want them to work in the way they were designed to do: quickly check email, browse the web, make calls, check messages and so forth.\nThat’s not the case in my professional life - developing software. We’re moving 100’s of people to Linux for development because it just works and it’s fast. We have an added advantage in the company I work for in that we can push the Linux distribution of our choice (previously Solaris) with our software product (we roll out the whole system from the hardware up). Our Linux desktops (SuSe) are remote and we’ll continue to have Windows laptops for Office and Email - not the most ideal situation.\nThe biggest surprise is how well Linux has been received even among ardent Windows developers (and we have a few). Our builds are faster, our environment can be easily scripted (which changes a new developers’ set-up time from days to hours) and because it’s remote, centrally managed and redundant - it’s easier to use all around. I’ve seen a lot of Windows rebuilds that require a total environment reset - this problem is solved now. The only issue for lost productivity is a network connection - but we’ve relied on that for server access, email, web and so forth.\nMy point here is the same point people have always made, Linux has a place and it’s mostly in business. Business is the web services people use every day, but it’s still Linux - just not the desktop layer (Gnome/KDE). Business is Android (we have an app just fir corporate customers where I work, not publicly released) but its not the Linux desktop.\nIn the meantime I’m considering Android devices (Nexus 7 looks good), a happy user if iOS devices (iPad/IPhone), a Windows laptop user for work, a Linux desktop/server user for work/personal use and I spend most of the remaining time on my MacBook Pro running OS X.

Right now you’re probably underestimating the amount of frustration and discomfort you’re about to experience, without realizing that by doing so you’re creating all sorts of subtle barriers to obtaining a deep understanding of programming.\nLanguage does matter I find this part extremely true: my first language is Java. Every programming language I’ve tried since has been through comparing it to Java. I’ve had criticism of each different language based on my assumptions. Scripting languages being prone to bad coding because they are not strictly typed, having to do tedious work with languages that require memory management (my time is too valuable!).\nYour first programming language provides you with a base vocabulary through which you begin to understand all other computer programs.\nProgramming is the best way to learn programming. Also another trueism. The best people in my class in college were those who had done the most code. But to transfer that to industry you have to have interpersonal skills, be willing to compromise, work well in a team etc. It sounds fluffy, but once you realise how much as a team you rely on other people (and how bad code merges, bad commits can cause a lot more work)1.\nIt’s OK to suck at math; you won’t be using much anyway. Also I’ve found this to be true. I wouldn’t be the worlds greatest at math (in fact they were the classes I felt most unease at in college)2. The author here is spot on about command of English. Professional programming (not necessarily what the article is about) requires a lot of communication. Like I said above, interpersonal skills is without doubt the most important attribute besides being technically competent. If your customer/stakeholder/manager can’t give you a design specification or you can’t read and understand an API, you’re instantly a lot less valuable. I’ve seen this in college also, a very proficient programmer who consistently did badly even at programming modules - because he never bothered to understand what was required in each task.\nI’ve commented enough, but it’s an excellent article which I find myself agreeing with all the way through.\n[API]: Application Programming Interface\nI’ve been responsible for both, bad merges and bad code. Its a fact of life and being too young and eager. You realise the value of the veterans is the cool head and measured approach they bring from years of experience. ↩︎\nAlthough I felt the most unease at maths, it’s mainly because of a poor attitude towards maths.

I have read several books I otherwise would have not read. What I don’t get is why otherwise well-healed and technology literate folk dismiss the Kindle out-of-hand. The most common reason? It’s not dead-tree paper. You can’t hold it. You can’t feel it. Yet the biggest thing they dismiss is me. It’s personal. I have an eye condition which means I wear hard plastic contacts all day long - my eyes get very tired, very easily.\nBut the Kindle is a wonderful reading device. I don’t read much books (I do most on-screen as I am on a computer constantly). It allows me and millions like me to enlarge the text and get a comfortable reading experience. I can adjust contrast (important when you suffer from shadowing/ghosting of an image) and much, much more. It also has on certain models a read-to-me computer generated voice. These advances cannot be dismissed and most importantly they aren’t offered by dead-tree books.\nI am sure the real book is beautiful, pleasant and looks the part with its fancy cover. But if I can’t read it comfortably, it’s next-to-useless. And that for me is end of sentence, paragraph and book (paper or e).\n","description":"","tags":["amazon"],"title":"Don't get a Kindle","uri":"/dont-get-a-kindle/"},{"content":"If your passion is in technology, you often sigh with the marketing buzzwords used in sales. Cloud Computing doesn’t actually mean anything specific (or could mean a lot of things). It’s that a lot of things to a lot of people who makes it useful as a term, an ideology, a way of explaining why you-oh-so-need-to-do-this-now. Cloud computing for me is a platform description. I think of the myriad of hosting companies who offer a platform to build your service atop.\nTechnology has been and will continue to be all about platforms. Look at Windows, the perfect example of an “open” platform that is actually very, very closed. Open in the sense it makes you feel fuzzy inside with all the control you seem to have. But closed when the platform operator decides they need a change of direction and emphasis. If your smart, you realise this and either a) kick the football down the road or b) do your best to plan ahead. Either option is sub-optimal. What platforms do offer you is a foundation to build upon. They save you time, money, engineering talent and when they work well are indispensable.\nIf you build the platform, you can make a lot of money. Just ask Amazon and Microsoft. Facebook, Twitter and Google are still ramping up their platform efforts. Adobe has just announced the realised their very valuable Flash platform is dead on mobile devices. They realised platforms are very purpose specific (to be valuable) and that value is in the already-mature desktop market - the investment in mobile wasn’t worth it. Adobe has always made money from the tools (as has Microsoft, apart from selling the platform Windows they sell Office, Sharepoint etc) and is focusing on targeting a larger platform in HTML5. If Adobe succeeds they’ll make a lot more money, or even if they capture a small section of the market which is bigger then the previous flash creation tools market.\nMonetisation is also tricky for platforms. Amazon’s strategy is similar to Wal-Mart, make it big, reliable and cheap. Only big companies can ever compete with Amazon on that scale. Smaller companies must rely on getting as many people to their platform as possible (to get as big) or creating a niche in say highly regulated environments which are high value but low volume.\nIn short: Platforms are good, but know when to jump off !\n","description":"","tags":["google","hardware","internet"],"title":"All About Platforms","uri":"/all-about-platforms/"},{"content":"I always enjoy watching shows like CSI for the over-the-top depiction of current technology. They obviously have people in know, it’s not like the script writers of major shows cannot get someone to consult them on technology (or maybe they don’t - sometimes I do wonder).\nThe video below is about IRC (Internet Relay Chat). They are correct it’s primitive (it’s all text) and hackers do actually use it (groups like Anonymous), but you can’t track someone to their living room using just an IP address!! The montage about the boats trying to explain how IRC works is off-the-wall insane crazy. WHY?!?, alas:\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2rGTXHvPCQ]\nAlso I found the gem below, where an assistant says she’ll “Create a GUI in Visual Basic to track the killers IP address”. And while she’s creating that Graphical User interface, anyone in the know can only assume the killer used that time to get away! No-one creates a GUI to display a number, all you can track is already on the web with a quick search for “IP Lookup”. This is a buzz-word fest to seem very high-tech!\nBut having said all of that, these videos are very entertaining.\n","description":"","tags":["video"],"title":"Hollywood Tech","uri":"/hollywood-tech/"},{"content":"I have recently switched my main desktop over to Arch Linux. If you have never heard about Arch Linux, it is a “roll your own” Linux distribution. This basically means from start to finish, the whole process is custom. Whether your system has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or sound is totally up to you.\nI switched from Ubuntu Linux, which is very much built for new people to Linux. I have been using Ubuntu since it’s release in 2004 (as old as this blog incidentally). I have found it slowly moving away from my power user needs from the release of the KDE 4.0 desktop up to the recently introduced Unity desktop for Ubuntu. Don’t get me wrong I love the whizz-bang effects of the snazzier distributions (like Ubuntu) and have used it to show people the power of Linux (and how really groundbreaking Compiz effects were at the time, ~2005). It’s sad Compiz hasn’t got the kudos but since both Windows and OS X have copied from Compiz, some more usability has been gained.\nBut alas these features aren’t really for me. I work professionally with computers all day and what matters to me most now are speed and efficiency. I am not productive if a desktop issue causes a slow-down (as Aero often does on Windows) or even a crash (Mac spinning beach ball, anyone?).\nThe most important reason why I switched to Arch itself is because of the rolling release feature. It doesn’t have set releases like Ubuntu (every six months) but updates constantly. This suits my workflow a lot better because a lot of software I use on Linux gets very regular updates now (Chromium, Eclipse, Calibre, Firefox, Amarok, etc). I also hate upgrades between releases and I think smaller more manageable updates (even if small issues arise) will provide a much better experience.\nAfter all there’s only so much coffee you can drink when your machine is taking a long time to respond!\n","description":"","tags":["linux"],"title":"Faster with Arch","uri":"/faster-with-arch/"},{"content":"I haven’t been posting much lately because I have been working hard to improve the experience of visiting this website. You may ask what does that mean? - well it is simple. I love going to websites that are uncluttered, provide useful information and are to the point. It’s also small things like having a really fast page load time. So here’s a flavour of some of what I have been working on lately…\nNavigation improvements Brand new menu, which can hold nested menus, images and more (much more flexible). Proper Sitemap, Atom and RSS feeds Accessibility keys can now be used to navigate to every page on the menu (for screen readers) Speed improvements Blockquotes are now 100% CSS - no images. Other post elements will follow when CSS3 allows. I am in the process of downsizing all images to thumbnail size (as a bonus if you click on it you’ll get beautiful full size image goodness) Maintainability Improvements All posts are now written in Markdown, which is like plain text. Makes me updating old posts with bad info way easier. The history of every page in the repository and can be referenced and restored (indeed I use it to constantly roll out and back changes/improvements). Permalinks will be provided at the end of each page. Posts can be safely linked to now and should always work. I’ve started adopting Microformats around the site as a way to feed search engines and crawlers more useful information on both myself and the websites content Similiar to Microformats, I’ve marked up posts so services such as Readability and Instapaper should have no trouble parsing out all the stuff they don’t need (such as site navigation, comments etc.) Images are getting or will have alternative tags for the visually impaired. and more to come…\nThere is still going to be a lot of broken posts for various reasons - I am doing my best to review and update as many as I can. Unfortunately changing blogging platform and having 150+ posts (since 2004) doesn’t make updates easy, but once things are fixed I’ll have a better idea of how to avoid such mess in future.

We’ve had full body scanners at airports, marshalls on flights, bombs hidden in toner cartridges and two wars. I reflected on this and remembered two really good articles I’ll share here on the topic. Hopefully we’ve changed for the better.\nYesterday I finally wrote something that’s been bothering me for about ten years: The fact that Al Qaeda can’t be as big and bad as it’s made out to be, because its whole design violates every rule of guerrilla organisation. It’s like a counter intelligence officer’s dream, the Al Qaeda plan to bring guerrillas from all over the world, introduce them to each other, and exchange funds, material and ideas.\nIt was pure cowardice that kept me from saying that sooner. A good lesson for me in not listening to the majority. The majority, the media, whatever you want to call it-maybe “the background noise” is the best way to describe it-kept saying that Al Qaeda was the biggest baddest thing in history and even though I grumbled and held back a little, I bought into that idea way more than I should, knowing the way I did that everything about their set-up pointed to a flash in the pan-which is what they’ve turned out to be. Back in 2005, when the Al Qaeda hoax was hitting its peak, I wrote a column called “Nerf War and Real War: Al Qaeda vs. IRA.” If you want a good quick lesson in why dummies like me have such a hard time understanding guerrilla warfare, even when they’ve got all the info they need right in front of them, just read that article. I re-read it yesterday, after a reader pointed out that I’d praised Al Qaeda for going all out and was being inconsisent in yesterday’s blog for saying they blew their assets. - WN 38 IRA VS. AL QAEDA: I WAS WRONG\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, the sheer demand for information sent news site after news site crashing down, especially in the US, leaving the world once more glued to the telly for the up-to-the-minute details of what was taking place.\nThe Register did its best. Generally, the site stayed up, and in response to email requests from Americans who were stuck at work, Reg hacks posted rolling updates, sourced from TV and radio, as the disaster unfolded.\nTen years on, things have changed. For starters, internet infrastructure is much more robust. In 2011, the internet still hasn’t beaten TV for serving up breaking news, but it’s at least an equal player now, with news organizations trawling Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and personal blogs to find out what is happening on the ground.\nTen years after the Twin Towers: What’s the Reg angle?

I did not get the 3G version to keep costs down (no second carrier subscription in addition to smartphone I own). Here’s my review, let it be noted I’ve been an iOS user since version 2 (iPhone 3G) and although I have used devices from Android 1.6 and up - I’ve never ’lived’ with them.\nMotorola Xoom Aesthetics \u0026 Design First of all the design is very well executed. It looks and feels like a premium tablet should (should that be iPad competitor?). The ports are a clear winner and still are over any other tablet. I haven’t got the video dock yet, but I ampositiveit’ll be a great addition to my big HDTV. The only gripe really is that it doesn’t charge through usb, which I believe is because it has two batteries. It charges through supplied plug insanely fast! It lasts all day and then some with heavy use also. I haven’t left the thing alone long enough to test the standby time, but I am sure it’s good also. The 10.1\" screen feels like the ‘right’ size for a tablet and I’ll besurprisedif more tablets don’t end up adopting a screen size closer to the Xoom’s. The heft is a bit much, I would like it to be a small bit lighter - but nearly all tablets with proper glass screens will be heavy.\nAndroid 3 - Honeycomb! Honeycomb is wonderfully designed and feels just like the Xoom - premium. I am a user of Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and now Android, so I never find the perfect experience anywhere and love bits of each. There are a few things iOS has me trained to expect, which I haven’t gotten in Android. One of my biggest frustrations at the moment is a lack of background video - iOS has this down and then some. The other is the really nice design of applications - one can’t hide the fact most Android apps feel less premium. Having said that the tablet market is still young, and I just found a beautifully designed purpose-built Honeycomb podcasting client - BeyondPod (an example of following Honeycomb layout).\nHoneycomb is as has been described in the multiple review sites I consulted - tron-like in feeling. It’s got that cool unhealthy blue glow that looks a bit futuristic. It’s still buggy around the edges and mostsurprisingly this affects the Google applications more, some are still being updated (Gmail, Reader). Like the iPad but better is the ability to either zoom or stretch applications made for the phone for the big screen. This made many 3rd party apps run flawlessly - most noticeably all the games with their custom user interfaces looked just as good if not better!\nApp Store vs. Market I’ll spill the beans here: I started looking for apps I already knew from my iPhone on the Xoom. Surprisingly, I found the vast majority of them. Apple’s App Store exclusives are getting rarer it seems. Overall my feel is this: App store has better quality apps, all useful apps are pretty much paid (bar top shelf free ones - Dropbox, Twitter etc). Android Market has mostly free for anything you need (at a lesser quality) BUT the top quality apps (like BeyondPod) are more expensive. My gut tells me App Store will cost you more over time, while the Android Market prices make you question if you really need the app (for really good apps).\nConclusion Overall a fantastic device. I would buy it now that the price has come down if: You don’t mind upgrading again in a year or two (iPad the same), use and like Android and think you would like the option to mess with the device by developing/rooting. It’s great hardware and because it’s Google certified it’ll follow all the releases of Honeycomb which is sure to get more exciting as competition to the iPad heats up.\nOverall 8/10\n","description":"","tags":["hardware","review"],"title":"Review of the Motorola Xoom Wifi","uri":"/review-of-motorola-xoom-wifi/"},{"content":"I got a Plantronics .655 USB Headset mainly for the ability to do VOIP well. Those of you who come here often know I reviewed Sennheiser HD595 before, which is a headset built for the quality of reproduction (I use that one for music).\nThere’s not much you can say about a VOIP headset, so I am going to keep this short! The Plantronics .655 USB isn’t the most comfortable headset and the usb connection seemed like a plus as I’d never owned a USB headset. The mic quality is a lot better with the USB connection (though I am guessing 90% is down to the fact it’s directional and pointed at your mouth), but the sound won’t be.\nPlantronics has basically discontinued this product although you can still buy it. If price is an issue, I recommend this as a decent headset, if not a tad disappointing in the comfort stakes. Plantronics have newer models out similar to this - some more expensive and some cheaper. If the price point is a winner, they offer decent value for money.\n","description":"","tags":["hardware","review"],"title":"Plantronics .655 USB Headset Review","uri":"/usb-headset-review/"},{"content":"I try to listen to as many podcasts (netcasts?) as I can.

But for myself, I want faithful reproduction and not headphones targeted at a certain genre - HD595’s prove a good fit.\nTo compensate for the lack of targeting of genres, I’ve found it necessary to use an equalizer once or twice - but mainly to satisfy my need for bass or drum cymbals and reinforce the beat of a song that’s probably on too loud for my own good anyway. Normal people shouldn’t be this fussy, but then again most people don’t spend this amount of coin on headphones (as one work colleague remarked to me: Your mad! - after hearing the cost, he liked the ‘phones though). The benchmark song I usually use is the Robert Miles classic “Children”. I think if you can hear all the fine intricacies of that song, your getting fairly good sound reproduction, in my humble opinion.\nIn the end all I really wanted was a portable alternative to my Creative 7.1 surround sound system (which I reviewed here a few years back) but having said that I was under no illusion headphones could replace a very-powerful, room oriented acoustics. HD595’s do the best job I could have ask of them - but one major gripe is the are not portable music player friendly. Why? 6.3mm as the default jack with a clumsy 6.3 to 3.5mm jack and the extremely long cord included in the pack. It’s great to dock at a desk and with the included dock adaptor it’s more clearly aimed at this type of market. Or maybe Guitar players with the jack size? I imagine it’s probably good for electric guitar players, but I wouldn’t know being allergic to instruments unfortunately. The openear design (it has holes to allow sound escape at the side of your ears) certainly improves listening, but will annoy anyone near enough to hear it, so please forget these for commuting!! Overall a great buy if you plan to use them as much as I have and will.\n","description":"","tags":["hardware","review"],"title":"Sennheiser HD595 Review","uri":"/senn-review/"},{"content":"I purchased the iPhone 4 shortly after its release in Summer 2010. I have obviously been so quick to review this device, the iPhone 5 is upon us! My philosophy for reviewing items is you have to live with them. Well boy have I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do marvel at how good the hardware is. I’ve dropped this extremely expensive device on occasions too numerous to count, so luckily it is designed well.\nApps I have a very large collection of paid apps, two-thirds of which have been impulse buy, maybe I’ll need them someday types. It’s a very expensive platform to get involved with, for sure - but the quality of some apps has been far better than their desktop counterparts - the one that springs to mind is Tweetie (now Twitter for iPhone). Some unforgettable games that take great advantage of the platform have sprung up - my favourite by far is Cut the Rope. Another is Angry Birds. None of these or any games I’ve played have made really good use of the iPhone 4’s sensors of which there are many - Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Compass, Camera etc. Sure I’ve played driving games but I always feel stupid using the iPhone as a mock steering wheel. If you’re an app junkie like myself, check out AppAdvice (yes another app) for nice and easy reviews. I’ve also found Lifehacker hive five series for iOS help inform me when there’s a number of popular apps for a platform.\nCamera One of the best features of the iPhone 4 is without a doubt the camera. It’ll obviously never replace an SLR and my compact point and shoot HP Camera is still better but that’s all negated by the ease of use of iPhone camera. It’s with you all the time and has the best sharing tools (and quick editing tools) of any camera out there. Great Camera related apps include Flickr, Instagram, Toonpaint and the included Photos app. I’ve shared more photos directly on a one-to-one basis than ever before, usually after I take the picture with my iPhone - someone requests it and I mail it or upload to Flickr or Instagram seamlessly. It’s definitely the future of photos, the past was hovering around a device or printed photos.\nConclusion People still are in awe of the iPhone 4 and personally I don’t think that’s justified or justifiable any more. Yes its beautiful hardware and software, but the competition has caught up to Apple. It’s still the best out there as far as I can see, but by that measure it’s also far too expensive. I’ve used mine for App development and even still, as a power user, I think the price is the single biggest turn off. iPhones do hold their value, which is a relief, should you wish to switch platforms or upgrade to iPhone 5. So my recommendation? If you have iPhone lust - buy one - but be ruthless and be willing to sell it on within 12 months to get something better… that something is up to you!\n","description":"","tags":["review","apple","hardware"],"title":"iPhone 4 Review","uri":"/iphone4-review/"},{"content":"A multitude of websites have been reporting the impending doom of ipv4 exhaustion, which is going to happen soon. All the top level address’ will be gone, but the regional registries will still have stocks of address’ in to 2011. As a user of ipv6, I thought I could share sone thoughts/insights on the events ahead…\nBelow is a very good video which one of my favourite tech shows, Hak5 made with an IPv6 Consultant, Joe Klein.\nMy own experience has been straightforward on the set up side of things. We had to purchase an Apple Airport Extreme router however, which is the biggest pain in the transition, the cost. Most home routers do not have proper IPv6 capability, a serious problem. This will cost the Internet Service providers a lot of money in keeping these old routers shielded from the ever increasing IPv6 enabled websites and services - to the point at which a large scale upgrade may well be cheaper, but this is not likely to happen in the short term.\nSetup of IPv6 The funny thing with IPv6 is that machines self issue address’ and can use them locally if you have an IPv6 capable router, defaulting to IPv4 when going through your NAT to the Internet. So it’s the bridge to your ISP is the issue. Where I set it up, my ISP is small and has no IPv6 support. I emailed them about it, to get no response. It’s probably worth trying again since most ISP’s are running trials now, and you may get a router upgrade if you opt-in now. So I had to set up a tunnel, using the excellent Hurricane Electric. My ISP is slow though (average 1mbps rural wireless) and when the tunnel is set up all traffic defaults to IPv6, it makes it even slower. Tunnels are not ideal because the result will always depend on the quality of connection to your tunnel provider and the overhead that provides. Since IPv6 packets are bigger than IPv4 packets, your going to get a lot more IPv4 packets for the same volume of traffic, the major downside of tunneling. Tunnels are good to get some IPv6 experience, but not much else unless you have a very fast connection. The transition itself will probably look like this:\nTunnels are set up, small contained IPv6 networks exist (already happend) IPv6 islands merge, major ISP’s peer and inter-network communication switches to IPv6 (happening now) ISP’s start to use 4to6 tunnels to get to the IPv6 part of the Internet ISP’s switch equipment and use 6to4 tunnels to get to ever decreasing IPv4 Internet Like Usenet, ISPs state there is no demand for IPv4, and drop it to be fully native IPv6 So I’d advise anyone right now who has the patience and the interest to invest time in IPv6, it’s a game-changing technology, not necessarily better but a must to have knowledge of. As I mentioned earlier Hurricane Electric provide free tunnels (you can even set it up on a single computer if your router can’t support IPv6) and free certification to test these skills.\n","description":"","tags":["networking"],"title":"Thoughts on IPv6","uri":"/thoughts-on-ipv6/"},{"content":"I wrote this script recently for a friend in a job who needed to output a certain percentage of a log file, but no more and no less.

I have been searching for a good blogging engine ever since I have started blogging. I have yet to find the perfect one :) Some have come close in completeness (WordPress) or price and ease of use (blogger), but none has been all-encompassing. I messed around with a blogging engine called Jekyll about a year and a half ago, but I never ended up deploying it. I had my website most recently on Google Sites, and the ease of use was pretty good, but themes-wise it was pretty frustrating, also they force an ugly footer on all pages, yuck.\nThere are a few reasons I have made the switch to Jekyll, mainly because I have got the ultimate cool factor in the setup of all this. I write all of my posts in plaintext, like Notepad (for reference for Windows users out there). This means in 100 years time they’ll still be readable (if anyone so wishes to read them). I’ve seen enough computer formats to know each one of them suck in some way. Plain text just sucks that little bit less because it’s been around since the dawn of computer time (bar weird encoding, which is sorted now I hope with UTF standard). It also simplifies my switch away from Jekyll, which I have learned is the most important feature of any blogging platform. Jekyll takes this text, combines it with some nice visual cruft you see all around the text and makes it nicely readable. As it transfers it in to folders as html, any web server software can serve this website. Making it plain html also makes it lightning fast to load (since there is no PHP or other dynamic languages being used).\nSo at this point your saying - okay? so what? Well the cool part is I use Git to save all my hard work, making undo actions to this website (I would say mistakes, but I don’t make any :) ) extremely easy and fast! Also is the coolness of Dropbox, my whole generated Jekyll site is synced to my server to be displayed here as it’s finished. So it’s very, very fast in almost every respect and it’s backed up like crazy and I use my favourite text editor (in a terminal shell if I need) to edit all this loveliness. I was partly inspired to do all of this by this blog post, which I’d seen back in 2009 when I was researching Jekyll. Although the work in this system is in the setup, it is super easy to use once set up. I can even create posts on my iPhone, using the many apps which hook in to Dropbox to edit files stored there.

You can whitelist good ads, and an argument could be had your harming websites revenue stream, but a lot of nasty tricks such as spyware, malware have used ads as a vector to spread. Not least the dishonesty some sites use in splitting up articles in to 10 pages to pump ad revenue. KB SSL Enforcer\nIf you don’t know what https or ssl means don’t worry. All it is encrypted webpages which protect your information between you and that website. Commonly used in banking online, it is now spreading to sites like Facebook, Gmail, Twitter and the like as a more secure way to protect your information. This extension turns it on without you even noticing! Vanilla\nnot that nice flavour of ice-cream! - A Cookie Whitelist Manager that helps protect your privacy. Automatically removes unwanted cookies.What are cookies? Little text files that website use to remember who you are. It’s okay if you have an account and log in, but the trouble arises when nefarious people use it to track which sites you visit. Bookmark Sentry\nA bookmark scanner that checks for duplicate and bad links. I imported 100’s of bookmarks from firefox collected over about 4/5 years at least. Websites change, move content, you can accidentally bookmark a website twice. This helps get your bookmarks working for you and being useful again! Site to Phone\nsends links from your browser to your phone or tablet - be it Android, Nokia, or Apple iOS device. You bookmark a page on your mobile device and install this nifty extension in Chrome, when you click the button, next time you open that page on your mobile deivce, it will open it automatically. Webpage Screenshot\ndoes what it says on the tin, but can take a screenshot of the whole page of a website, no nasty scrolling and trying to stitch to halves of a screenshot together, works like magic! Google SSL Web Search\nprotects your web searches from prying eyes. Can use an option in Chrome or be set as the main search engine. About:Flags (Chrome Beta only for now\nMost people won’t know about Chrome’s about:flags (open a new tab, enter about:flags, hit enter), similiar to Firefox’s about:config and possibly just as dangerous, it presents “under the hood” options normal users wouldn’t need to touch. Some of them are very cool to use and will no doubt cement Chrome’s market share gains. Here’s my favourites:\nTab Overview: Enables Expose like Mac OS X interfaces for swapping between tabs, very cool1\nDisable outdated plug-ins: Disables plugins if Chrome knows about security problems with your old version of the plugin.

I haven’t bought the first generation iPad because the lack of a camera on a device so obviously good for fullscreen video calls has baffled me. I guess they have to store up some ideas since they need a new hardware iteration every year, Apple’s revenue model depends on that vital hardware refresh cycle.\nI think the huge leaps the iPod has made in the 9 years of it’s existence is an Indicator of the iPad’s future more than the iPhone is. Which sounds confusing because the iPhone/iPad are such close relatives in software and hardware terms. The iPod when released had laughably small (even for 2001) memory and a FireWire port (not common then) to being one of the biggest consumer success’ of all time. It started off with low memory, buttons to press, black and white screen to iPod Colour/Photo to Nano to iPod Touch born from iPhone. I think the iPad will be the rising star and technology will be back-ported from it to iPhone (instead of other way round as has happened to date).\nThe form factor is what gives it that advantage. I wouldn’t be surprised to see 3D movies or a table made out of iPad screens (like Microsoft has done), and they’re just obvious uses. Pico projectors would be ideal for iPad sized device before being ported to phones. But this is all obviously future features, down the line eventually. I think the big surprise will be future software integrations and hardware sensors to do all sorts of crazy input leading to all new kinds of areas not immediately obvious, like the iPhone being such a big gaming success, which no one predicted: fingers are a very clumsy medium but it turns out a whole new category of game sprung up like Angry Birds or Cut the Rope.\nSo I see this innovation in the pipeline and I think iPad first gen is very first gen. Future iPads may be a distant cousin just like original iPod and iPod touch are. So it’s a thing I will hold off on investing in for a few years because iterations will move so quickly.. your only paying directly for the later version you really want!\n","description":"","tags":["apple","hardware"],"title":"iPad Evolution?","uri":"/ipad-evolution/"},{"content":"So I was listening to some music, thinking about the announcement today on Anglo Irish Bank that we have 32% national debt and my generation will be expected to pay that.

I thought I’d give it a run-down for potential buyers on my experience for the first week. Firstly I should mention, I’ve never owned another Garmin unit, and had two mobile GPS’ units before (one being Nokia N800 with Bluetooth external GPS and other Apple iPhone 3G). The reason I bring this up is that a lot of the reviews I’ve seen written compare it to it’s predecessor, Zumo 550, which obviously I can’t do.\nMaps What good is a GPS without good map quality? Garmin’s maps are by Navteq, and generally are of a good standard here in Ireland. The only roads it has presented trouble with are roads that have opened in the last 6 months, which I guess were too soon to be compiled in to the quarterly updates they provide (of which one should be free when you register). Lane assist comes with the unit, and although only works for me with high profile and busy junctions, it is well worth the inclusion.\n##Custom Maps Garmin allow a cool feature called custom maps, which means you can overlay images, giving the edge GPS co-ordinates, so that your map can replace a section of theirs. A good example would be replacing Dublin Zoo map with all the attractions (Lions, Tigers etc) visible on your GPS. Similar to this is a not oft published feature allowing you to have supplemental maps, be they Garmin official (I have Australia and New Zealand) or from other sources, such as OpenStreetMap (OSM). OpenStreetMap is always more up-to-date than any maps Garmin will release, but accuracy is always a problem given the wiki nature. Nevertheless OSM can include contours in a topographical style, which are the most expensive maps to purchase.\nPOI\nPOI stands for Points Of Interest. They are the Hospitals, Restaurants and Fuel stations listed on your unit. While Garmin’s included list is good and somewhat comprehensive, OpenStreetMap ones were good to have. Most of the OSM ones end up in the wrong format and look slightly odd, but are fairly accurate. You can only have one set of custom Points of Interest, so it’s worth bearing that in mind if you need more (combine them).\nSetting up the unit Set-up is extremely straight forward and doesn’t require more skill than hanging a picture really. You get a RAM mount, which you can choose to either use the U bracket or the clutch handle mount, fitting almost all motorcycles. I had to use the clutch mount on my motorcycle, I simply didn’t have the bar space to mount the unit anywhere else. The RAM Mount plate screws into the Garmin mount, and the ram mount is held on to the base by a dual ball and socket joint, allowing maneuverability on the GPS. There’s a thumb screw on the ball joint to stop it moving when a comfortable position is found.\nI then wired the units four molded wires (all in one wire until the end run) under my tank, with the\npositive and negative to their respective terminals on the battery. I didn’t want to fiddle around with my ignition, so I just wired it direct (Garmin says it draws less than 1/2 milliamp with no unit in place), which after a week doesn’t seem to have affected my battery. Their is a fuse on the positive side, so that is a welcome addition. The other two wires are 3.5mm female jacks for connection to a pre-existing motorcycle entertainment unit, or for using directly. I;ve used the 3.5mm jack directly for headphones, and found they worked well (although bog standard headphones in helmets can be sore and you have to make sure to ‘detach’ yourself getting off). For those reasons I’ve been looking at purchasing a Scala G4 Powerset Bluetooth headset (which incidentally comes in a bundle with the TomTom Competitor: The Rider).\nI paired my current phone, Apple iPhone 3G without any issues. It will load your phonebook on to the device, but does not do this immediately (let it stay actively paired for a while), although immediately after pairing you can dial any number you like. I’ve only dialed using the inbuilt mic and speaker on the unit while stationary and the quality seemed acceptable, but would definitely be more useful if a headset was used. No SMS functionality is available which is an Apple limitation, disappointing in my opinion (would like to see SMS’ pop up onscreen!). You can see compatible phones on Gamin’s Bluetooth phone list.\nUsing Computer Software I’ve only used BaseCamp and it’s poorer cousin RoadTrip on Apple Mac OS X, which is the main mapping and routing software (on Windows it’s called MapSource). I’ll start off with the biggest limitation: crappy maps on your computer. The software (probably due to licensing) only comes with a very poor ‘basemap’ which is a bog-standard zoomed out view on the map. If you like me wanted to look at your favorite locations, your out of look as they’ll appear on a blue sea-like background. I ‘fixed’ this by using an OpenStreetMap (which incidentally is a good way to test accuracy for your locale).\nAlso for Windows and Mac is POI Loader, which helps you load any custom Points of Interest you may have.m As I mentioned earlier, only one “extra” (in addition to Garmin included ones) set can be loaded on, so if you want say custom speed cameras and Open Street Map POI or Geocaching locations, you’ll have to combine them using other tools first.\nGeocaching Geocaching is GPS treasure hunting, for want of a better explanation, or see Groundspeak’s informative video. GPS units with a good accuracy level are needed, as well as good maps. Some of the most popular units used are topographical ones, but you can use a road GPS like the Zumo 660. Geocaching used to require printing out co-ordinates and clues, and then inputting that manually. I found an excellent website/guide to do Paperless Geocaching. You need to subscribe to Geocaching.com to get the relevant points around you, but you get a lot of information in to the Zumo - like size of the cache, logs of people who last found it, the hint, the location blurb and so on.\nIf you never done Geocahcing.com you can join and print caches for free, then input co-ordinates in to the Zumo (Where to? Menu \u003e Co-Ordinates) to see if you like it. The only major difficulty is the last few meters, as you’ll want to go to in to pedestrian mode, and then use the compass to get the exact spot (which you have to look at co-ordinates for). At this point I grow impatient and just use my iPhone to get me the last few meters, but it’s only happened once. It definitely saves my iPhone battery since the Zumo is run off the vehicle, so no worries there. Also cool is the way you can set a distance before loading the points, so if you drive past a Geocache location you can be alerted. You can set alert distance lower or higher depending on your will (it could get annoying in a big city with a large radius!!).\nLogs and Favorites I found it easy to add my custom locations, such as family, friends etc. It can be done through the unit or done through the software on a computer. The computer version for some unknown reason won’t use addressing information on the unit, so finding the address you need, if present, is best done on the unit. Other than that for rural Irish locations, I used Google Maps in Satellite/Map view and used the latitude and longitude lab extensions to right click on a place and get co-ordinates. I then copy and pasted these in to the Garmin software as a custom waypoint (warning: they both use different format for co-ordinates, so be careful and double check location after).\nLogs are a cool way to check your mileage, average speed, etc. Logs are automatically kept each time you select a location to travel to. For those of you out there like me, who like graphs, even probably meaningless ones, there a good (and free) service from Garmin called: Garmin Connect. You can see all your route information on a shareable Google Map, and export it to Google Earth. Links to this information can be shared on Twitter, Facebook etc. I made a trip out to a friend of mine and within minutes of arriving home I sent him the details of my route out to him (which was useful as I found it hard to explain all the turns I took getting there).\n##Overall conclusion A well made unit, with regular firmware updates, it’s hard not to recommend the Garmin Zumo 660 if you can afford the steep price a fully waterproof, ruggedized car and motorcycle unit comes in at (about € 550/$750). I got mine because I plan to use it for both uses, as well as Geocaching, monitoring mileage and routes to save fuel, etc. The mount for me is solid when the unit is held (and my unit is exposed, not behind my screen, so it gets the wind) but it’s hard to know sometimes whether the unit “clicked” properly in to the mount. That’s obviously a concern since you don’t want to drop the unit at speed. It has also frozen and shutdown twice, but that’s been resolved by a firmware update and hasn’t happened since.\nI like Garmin’s interface better than almost any other GPS maker (bar Google Maps navigation, which is not as comprehensive yet, and only on phones), so ease of use is good in my opinion (esp. with gloves). A telling endorsement is the fact BMW and Harley-Davidson embed these units with new motorcycles.\nOverall a solid unit for the small market of Motorcycle ready GPS units, a must buy for bikers who intend to travel and can justify the cost.\n","description":"","tags":["review","hardware"],"title":"Garmin Zumo 660 Motorcycle GPS","uri":"/motorcycle-gps/"},{"content":"Wow… what a weird feeling, I have a degree under my belt.

A recent episode covered Haiku - an open source operating system based on the design of the old BeOS. What’s very interesting about BeOS is the design, an integrated all in one operating system - and the fact Apple almost purchased it. That’s amazing to me, literally in one fell swoop, if Apple had of offered the 200 million Be Systems wanted, there would be no NextStep into Apple and by extension - Steve Jobs. It’s especially poignant since Apple just surpassed Microsoft to become the second most valuable American company.\nThe most spiritually similar of todays operating systems would be Mac OS X, as it brings the integration BeOS was after. I’ve only played with Haiku in a virtual machine, but already I am impressed. It’s a well designed system, not as buggy as I expected - it’s only on alpha2 after years of development. There’s already a lot of applications, all native and therein lies the fault. The Web browser (not surprisingly) is the buggiest of all the applications I tried. Most apps are small one purpose apps, not hard to see a unixy philosophy. One of the developer’s mentioned a port of QT, which could bring QT based apps such as Skype, KDE apps.\nApps or Web?\nI think the biggest use of Haiku could be on net-books, it performed extremely well in limited virtual machine - so it’s a pity there’s no commercial sponsor to push it out. The developers mentioned a port of Java or GTK is not on the radar, so you can kiss good-bye to any Gnome or Java apps (Firefox, Chrome, OpenOffice.org), but they mentioned they will target web apps. This seems very curious without a major web browser, as anyone knows the web should be standards based but how often have we seen “Supports Chrome 3+ Firefox 3+ Safari 4+ IE7+” so if this is the agreed upon approach - they really need a major browser. As a computer science person, the design of the system interests me the most, vs others, but I haven’t dug too deep yet, when I do, I’ll be sure to post.\nHardware Support\nI haven’t dug in to this either, but anecdotally a good guess would be hardware support would be poor. The main hurdle and the majority of code in Linux is purely based on the millions of hardware combinations PC-based (X86) have to use. This is why for any traction for Haiku, I think hardware support needs to be OEM based, possibly like the white-label EEE PC netbooks.\nIf you like trying different operating systems, have a copy of VirtualBox or VMWare (and by extension a decently fast computer) give Haiku a try!\n","description":"","tags":["podcast","apple"],"title":"Haiku: Open Source BeOS clone","uri":"/haiku-open-source-beos-clone/"},{"content":"I’ve written about my desire for open web video before, and now it looks as if it’s finally going to happen.

Things most people replace easily are the handlebars, foot pegs, indicators and so on.\nExperiences on it It’s a comfortable motorcycle to sit on, but for someone used to a scooter design, where every limb is free bar right hand, it is tricky to start off with. Clutch control and gearing was totally new to me - so it took a bit of getting used too. Slowing down, starting up and switching gears smoothly are rough starting out, but in a few hours I’ve got basics down. It’s all road experience now - road holding, good control of the motorcycle, looking out for danger and indicating properly and well in advance.I’m not a fan of the Road Safety Authority in Ireland (a lot of their wacky suggestions if made law would put under 25’s off the road) but their goal of reducing road deaths is one being a motorcyclist I definitely support - they make a great leaflet on motorcycle safety (PDF), worth a read.\nHandling Handling seems like it should be quite bad, I mean with the Majesty I wasn’t used to seeing so much of the road!! But it is in fact measurably better than the scooter. I think it’s because it’s heavier and has better tyres for the frame than a scooter could ever have. The Majesty, typical of most scooters, has the engine on the back wheel, whereas the Bros, as can be seen in the pictures, has a lot of weight in the centre, towards the front. One video review on Youtube says’ BROS’ love backroads, it does in fact seem to love nice swishy corners.\nLooks\nBeing a naked bike, I felt naked on it a first, like there was very little protection from a fall. This can be good and bad. Good in that it reminds you that your close to the road, so don’t do anything stupid. Bad in that there is no protection from Wind, an element I consider worse than rain for safety, only beaten by ice. Does it make you a better driver? Probably so, you are not as insulated as you (thought) were on the Scooter.\nPurchase decision For me when purchasing it came down to a Honda Bros or a Honda CB250, I choose the Bros primarily because it look’s so much better on the eye. It has a bigger engine (thinking to keep long term after the test), has plenty of after-market parts (the CB250 can claim this also) and the engine has an impeccable reliability - one Bros I saw had 250,000 miles, yes that’s quarter of a million miles on a motorbike engine, and it was still going!\nEssential Links Honda Bros Video Review on Youtube Wikipedia Article on BROS Haynes Manual HawkWorks Service Manual Bros Servicing Fanpage Bros Written Review and Specifications\n","description":"","tags":["hardware","review"],"title":"Honda Bros Motorcycle","uri":"/honda-bros-motorcycle/"},{"content":"This is a 3rd Graphics project we presented as a group for Computer Science.

(Almost) everyone that I know of donates to charity on a regular enough basis. I’m a college student so I don’t donate as much as I should. But it really annoys me how the “main” charities run a campaign of guilt and spend millions on it. I’ve donated money to all of these charities, the third world aid charities. All of them spend far too much on paying people commission and advertising. One that I can think of off hand is asking people who donated more than €250 to sign a form and send it back.\nThis to me is astonishing, do people ignore letters from the charity asking for a simple tax refund (a tick box affair). This leads me to a few scenarios:\nThe Charity constantly bug people for money by letter - leading to people ignoring them People have no emotional and very little other connection to the cause - merely donating for self appeasement I suspect both may be true. The second point reminds me of the Catholic Churches insistence you pay for salvation before the reformation - people donate to make themselves feel better. Still this Charity must see it as money well spent if they predict to make it back.\nThis is part of the reason I am conducting more due diligence of Charities I donate to in future. I don’t want to subsidise kerb crawlers or massive TV and Radio campaigns to male me feel guilty - in fact I switch it off or change channels as soon as I see it coming. These tactics in my mind are unethical, I want to donate to a charity to help a cause not make myself feel better. I am not stupid - I know there is some mental payoff from donating.\nAlso what bugs me is the relationship to churches which some charities are not honest about - I don’t think this applies to Irish Charities except fringe ones - but definitely applies to some evangelical ones from the United States. Some have shown an appaling lack of ethics and moral compass in seeking to convert survivors of the Earthquake. There preying on people who’ve lost whole families in some cases. Can there conversion not wait until they can rebuild there homes and their lives?\nI am going to focus my future donations in my core area of competence - computing. I can judge measureable results and hold some of them to account better if I have the knowledge of the charities core aims and abilities. Likewise with Open Source software, which can help get computers in to hands of the poorest and help them educate themselves for tomorrow and get themselves out of the need for food aid today. Of course charities closer to home which I have interactions with (having two rescue dogs) the RSPCA and research into cancer (affected every family I’d guess) heart diesease (ditto).\nI think this post has cleared up my thoughts on two things: making sure you donate to something you care about and avoid at all costs those who seek to waste the money you have donated.\n","description":"","tags":["business"],"title":"Donating to Charity","uri":"/donating-to-charity/"},{"content":"One of our projects this semester is to make a Bauhaus Chess set in a program called 3DS Max (created by Autodesk). 3DS Max is a modeling and animation tool built specifically for creating 3D representations and models.

For me it has never mattered someone’s gender - I love using, tweaking and learning about computers and if you share that interest - the more, the better! It has been shown very young children are conditioned from a very young age by gender rules - shown by Prof. Robert Winston in Child of Our Time programme. So I’ve often wondered in a very skewed ratio of males to females (as generally there are more females than males in society) would affect a Woman’s choice of even considering Computer Science, since so few actually do. So I set about asking our class representative, Lauren Butler, her thoughts on Computers, doing Computer Science and being an authority figure in a male dominated class-room, my questions and her answers follow:\nNG = Neil Grogan - LB = Lauren Butler - ED = Editor\nNG: What first sparked your interest in Computers?\n** LB:** Learning computers in Secondary School, seemed like a cool thing. But obviously I had been playing computer games for years since the Sega Mega drive came out so in a way I had probably been into computers and not really realized.\nNG: Do you remember the first Computer you got?\nLB: Some Toshiba piece of heavy brick like crap but it had Windows XP on it yay, the battery charger connection broke and couldn’t power it anymore so now it’s dead and good riddance I say.\nNG: When did you first realise you’d like to do Computer Science? In School? Or after?\nLB: Secondary School filling out my CAO application because I couldn’t think of anything else. Guidance councilor said to do arts (typical response to a person that doesn’t know what to do) but I wanted to be a Garda (ed: a police officer in Ireland) and computers was my fall back. Long story short the Gard’s didn’t want me after the whole application process so I went to my plan B…computers.\nNG: Would you describe yourself as a Tomboy? You seem to fit the description of Heterosociality, ie. Preferring (or at least having to) have more male friends than female.\nLB: Yes I’m a tomboy, obviously it’s kinda of weird for a girl to like computers and computer games. I do have a lot of guy friends and I do find them easier to get along with but I have a good amount of girl friends too.\nNG: Do you remember you first perception of the female to male ratio of the class in first year (approx 3:40) ?\nLB: “JESUS I Can’t believe I’m going to have to be in a class with all boys…oh wait there’s 4 girls over there”\nNG: Did the fact that Computer Science is male dominated influence your choice negatively or positively?\nLB: Neither. but I do get on better with boys than I do girls so In a way it’s kind of better for me to be in a male dominated environment.\nNG: Do you feel female lecturers have been tougher or easier on you that you share gender? (ie. Common experiences)\n** LB:** I don’t think they have been tougher but I do find they can’t interact with me as well as they do with the males\nNG: Do you feel male lecturers have been tougher or easier on you that you differ in gender?\nLB: No I don’t think they have been either but I may get away with being a bit ditsy at times\nNG: Do you feel the fact the male to female ratio is skewed will help or hinder your career prospects?\nLB: No I don’t think it will affect it in any way and it should or at least I hope it will be based on academics.\nNG: What would it take to encourage more Women to consider Computer Science? What would you say to sell it to them as a profession?\nLB: I honestly don’t know but the fact that you can get into basically any part of the computer industry by doing this course could be an incentive.\n**NG: **Do you feel any aspect of the course is more male orientated? I remember one lecturer saying female students excel at coursework, but this reverses as projects come in later years, which males apparently do better at?\nLB: No I don’t think it’s more male orientated but maybe that lecturer thinks the more hands on stuff is more male orientated but if like me who is a tomboy that sort of thing should be more interesting, i.e fixing computers that’s my favorite thing, one of which we don’t do enough of.\nNG: As Class representative and a leader of the class, do you feel being a woman has positively impacted the class – i.e. That different experiences \u0026 differing management styles of Women can be a unifying force?\n**LB: **I really don’t think I have had any sort of impact on the class, I’m just a very open person and I’d like to think that anyone in the class could come and class to me.\n**NG: **Do you ever wish people would stop focusing on this male/female thing and that it all should be a meritocracy? It’s it stupid me asking these questions (have we already moved on?)?\n**LB: **I personally don’t see it being focused on the male/female thing. Especially now being in third year where we are being placed in groups to work on projects, we all use our talents and abilities to achieve a good grade. Defiantly in my group I work in I have never had a problem with my gender being focused on, as long as every one pulls they’re weight who really cares about gender.\n","description":"","tags":["software"],"title":"Interview - Being a Woman in Computer Science","uri":"/interview-being-woman-in-computer/"},{"content":"Some people make new years resolutions about eating healthier, exercising more etc. I find that boring, who doesn’t want to be healthier?

Not only do they have a number of handy engineering benefits such as isolating the water loop through the reactor from the water loop through the turbines, but they also have a particularly useful safety feature in that they’re self-regulating — temperature goes up, power output goes down. France has an excellent safety record; I can find only one major incident, which was a coolant spill in 2008. They even do their own waste reprocessing into plutonium, which is then reused to generate more power. Unaccountably, terrorists don’t seem to have stolen any of it.\nThis was the opposite “self-regulating — temperature goes up, power output goes down” in Chernobyl. You’ll have to forgive me as I wasn’t born then. It was re-iterated differently also:\nby Burning1 (204959)\nMore specifically, modern safe reactors have a negative void coefficient. As water vaporizes in an critically hot reactor, it reduces the rate of reaction. The hotter the reactor gets, the larger the void(s) in the coolant, the less reaction occurs.\nChernobyl had a positive void coefficient.\nThe main article was about running Nuclear plants over capicity (120% quoted) and putting contracts up for renewal when possible some plants should be end-of-lifed (EOL). Another submitter had an interesting point on the extended life:\nby jpmorgan (517966)\nThe plants were built to a certain design that had large safety margins… not because they were needed per se, but because the designers couldn’t prove they weren’t. Today, we can model all the behavior of the plants to a high degree, so we don’t need the same safety margins to keep these plants safe. You don’t need a cooling system with 50% excess design capacity, since we can prove that 25% is sufficient. We know now that the containment wall is twice as big as it needs to be, for the original design load. So, we can use the safety margins to run the plants longer and to higher capacity than the original design.\nChernobyl obviously is used in spades in either side of the argument. Those who favour Nuclear power point out that it can never happen again. Those who are against it use it as an example of what has happend with us mere mortals.\nby Burning1 (204959)\nThe Chernobyl reactor disaster happened because the operators decided to run a test, and turned off the automatic safety shut-down.\n…and because the reactor was of such a design that it could not have a proper containment vessel, and because the control rods had a major flaw in that initiating an emergency shutdown (SCRAM) would cause the reaction rate to INCREASE momentarily, and because the reactor had a positive void coefficient (will tend to increase the rate of reaction as the coolant vaporizes, without outside intervention), AND because there was insufficient instrumentation and operator training to identify the critical reactor condition until after the meltdown had started.\nThere was a perfect storm of design flaw and poor decision making that lead to the Chernobyl disaster.\nAlthough the nearby town of Pripyat was abandoned after the disaster, Reactors 1-3 continued operation. Reactor number 2 was damage in a fire, and shut down in 1991. Reactor 1 was decommissioned in 1996, and reactor number 3 was shutdown in 2000.\nPersonally, reading heavily into the Chernobyl accident has gone a long way towards improving my opinion on nuclear power. To see what it took to cause the most recognizable and most cited disaster, really puts things into perspective.\nSpossa came out with a good joke we all love:\nby sopssa (1498795)\nI’m a supporter of nuclear energy, but don’t let anyone dumb too close a nuclear power plant.\nIt’s good we have this guy [yfrog.com] in control of a nuclear power plant.\nOne thing I love Slashdot for is the informative links, like the one below of a back yard nuclear generator!:\nby slewfo0t (679988) Ahh, I see the eco-nuts are in full force with this post… Putting on tin-foil hat…\nNuclear power - PLEASE put one of these in my back yard! http://www.nextenergynews.com/news1/next-energy-news-toshiba-micro-nuclear-12.17b.html\nOne point we should never forget is that Chernobyl has concentrated the mind safety-wise:\nby QuantumRiff (120817\nI am a huge fan of Nuclear Power, however, I sometimes wonder if all the irrational fear of Nuclear Power was Good for the industry? I kinda think all the negative attention and scare tactics and stuff made the nuclear industry have to go over and above to continue proving, without doubt, that they were safe..\nThere was also well versed points that Coal plants would not meet the requirements if it was subject to Nuclear safety regulations. The bulk of the cost of Nuclear is in the safety of the plant and fuel reprocessing/dumping. Most have pointed out it’s quite viable to end up with very small amounts of lesser grade material with modern reprocessing.\nWhy all these comments? Well I wish we had a debate like this in Ireland. We are bar none the most reliant on fossil fuels (of which we produce almost none). Everytime it’s brought up in the media, ESB and people who represent them or are in the industry say (paraphrased) “Thats a matter for the 2030’s”. If you know it takes at least 20 years to get us up to speed (importing technology and people from France, UK etc) then why aren’t we having a debate now and a plan of action after 5 years, 2014/5 and beyond? There was an old Nuclear power board in the 80’s but it was disbanded on account of the Carnsore point objections.\nI firmly believe we have the power to think broader now, like we have on divorce, civil partnerships and so forth. That stuff could not have been implemented from what I understand in the 80’s either. Times move on and attitudes change. If we had a debate and the facts, I’m sure supporters of Nuclear energy in Ireland like myself would at least get an educated debate going - as it’s our energy future and money.\n","description":"","tags":["politics"],"title":"Nuclear Power Debates... why not in Ireland?","uri":"/nuclear-power-debates-why-not-in/"},{"content":"Gizmodo seem to think so:\nThe $2,500 Mac Pro, desperately in need of a refresh, gives you a 2.66GHz Quad-Core Xeon (essentially an i7), 3GB of RAM (triple channel, but seriously?), 640GB hard drive (again, seriously?) and a nominal graphics card.

For people outside of Ireland the total Journey distance was about 90 miles.\nI used only my iPhone on the O2 network and close to 50% of the time it seemed like I had 3G. This was on a train moving at speed, and YouTube played very well with little to no stutter. It did drop to Edge the other half of the time, with about 30% of time I still got speeds web browsing was acceptable on. So in summary: 80% of the time it was possible to surf the web.\nAfter that Journey I was also on a Dublin Bus, and I had full 3G coverage which comes as little surprise as Dublin Bus only serves densly populated Dublin and it’s environs.\nA few days later I went on a road trip to Athlone, and the coverage on the M4/M6 was not as good as I’d hoped. My theory on why the train was better is the fact on the routes I’ve been on a lot more urban areas are visited, thus the rollout has been very good to densely populated towns, but along motorways which are far away from such places: your sadly out of luck.\nHutchinson Whampoa (aka 3 Ireland) have recently got the national broadband contract to supply rural areas with 3G coverage, so most of these areas should be covered in the next few years.

This is framed in the mindset of all the past Nokia devices (which I have posted about here also) which I have owned.\nOkay so where to start? Well I think a good place would be what I could have bought instead. Strange place for a review; but its good to see what is out there and what I was looking at beforehand.\nNokia XpressMusic 5800 Nokia make great phones; I have stuck to the reliability of Symbian on their earlier phones for quite some time. I love Nokia; they mean reliability when you need your phone most - always a top feature other manufacturers never got quite right. Maybe its part inertia on my part - I can’t really say. Long story short is that this was a major competitor: over the iPhone it has expandability and a lot more hardware features (like RDS Radio), can play a lot more formats also. Downsides: Got terrible reviews for poor Symbian integration with touch; that plectrum looks downright stupid; it is not as sleek as iPhone in form factor (although it is smaller), screen didn’t seem as good to me.\nHTC Magic Follow up to the HTC Dream or GPhone; this Android device has probably the coolest developer OS around. Lots of activity is going on around Android at the moment; so the first phones to land in the UK and Ireland should be more polished (using next gen Android: CupCake). Their is even rumors it will be adapted and put on net books: possibly making it the standard of mobile devices if given enough time. This will only bring more cool apps in time and reduce Apple’s iTunes Store lead. Downsides: Not available yet; so I couldn’t buy it. Doesn’t have as much apps yet. Isn’t as polished in the software interface as iPhone. All of these can be resolved with time however…\nPalm Pre I hold out a lot of hope for this! Also Linux based; it promises a cool, open Web developer community as all the apps are online. Web apps need a lot more thought for offline use in my opinion, so I am reserving judgement on this. The interface seems to rock; and developing for it looks super easy… Downsides: not out yet, thus lack of Apps and pricing info.\nSome junk WinMob Says it all really: a smart-phone but for less than a good plain old non-smartphone. Always made by some obscure Taiwanese outfit - not that is a bad thing; after-all most iPhone parts come from there. For those on a budget this was my last option; but darn cheap; just over €115 for one! I could have bought one for every member of my immediate family for the price of one iPhone: makes you think, doesn’t it?\nOn to the review of the iPhone:\nPros:\nBeautiful Interface:\nIt looks amazing: lets be honest. I have never seen a phone look quite this good.\nFingers:\nUsing only your hands is great; lets face it: you cannot forget your hands. You can forget a stylus and even the iPhone itself; but those hands are sticking with ye!\n**Time: **\nI use my phone for time; Apple has it displayed elegantly, in the same place, almost in all the phones’ screens. I love this as I can keep myself aware of what I have to do next… All in glorious 24hr goodness, they way time was meant to be displayed…\nLots of apps:\nThe App store grows bigger every day and all those little useful Apps are really handy.\n**Quick Interface: **\nThe software interface is very fast at getting you to where you want to go; to that Twitter application or your Web mail etc.\nMaps and Location based services:\nI have seen the future: and it is the Internet that is location aware. iPhone has taken the first tentative steps in this area with allowing apps to use location; as well as building it into the camera and maps applications.\nGreat iPod:\nApple doesn’t lie on this one. It is a great iPod. The best? I haven’t decided yet… but it’s not far off…\nSafari:\nIt is the real web you get on an iPhone. Not only that: it is surprisingly comfortable to navigate with. I haven’t seen a mobile phone device come this close before. The N810 has a great browser with flash; but all round Safari wins on ease of use. I heard the earlier versions were very buggy; maybe I got in just as Safari matured properly.\nAccelerometer:\nChanging the view of applications as you rotate the phone was a masterstroke. Some things just need to be viewed vertically; others horizontally. The iPhone just makes it happen: seamlessly.. no buttons and no fuss. Thumbs up!\nSO-SO\nCamera:\nNot a lot to complain or praise about the camera. It does it’s job… Their is no flash or other trickery other phones have to offer; so any sub-optimal light and the iPhone may as well just not have a camera…\nCons:\nCost:\nIts darned expensive! I bought it contract-free and to say it burned a hole in pocket is an understatement.\nOne Inbox:\nNokia has this one on the button. I don’t care whether its SMS, MMS, E-Mail or a message through telekinesis: put it in one place please… It’s easier to check; and logically it makes more sense to not have to visit ten apps for each. Bonus points for allowing developers to hook in things like Twitter..\nSmudgy:\nIt smudges and scratches like nothing I have seen. They tried to make it too shiny; at the cost of usability. I would prefer a grippier, less pretty surface: but I am sure I am in a minority on this. I could probably have even been overheard muttering “Smudgy piece of ****” . Add to any price the cost of a cover…\n**Keyboard: **\nYes I know how ugly hardware keyboards look: but they do work. The on-screen keyboard to me: sucks. I much prefer the N810’s on-screen one that I can use with my thumbs. Using my index fingers just doesn’t feel right; and more to the point: all onscreen keyboards are crap. This is a major TODO for any willing iPhone competitor…\nBackground Apps:\nThis may sound like a minor niggle: it’s not. Only apps you can run in the background is the phone, iPod, Safari and Mail. I don’t even think Safari and Mail are true background apps; in fact I know they aren’t: they suspend when they are not at the forefront.\nStatus:\niPhone OS 3.0 is set to fix notifications; apps will be able to display a number next to their icon. I personally don’t think that is good enough. Is a notification area as seen on other phones (you know for like calendar?) too much to ask?

IRMA is the Irish Music Rights Organisation which represents the big four record companies and their bottom line: never the artist. They have recently tried to regulate the Internet and have forced the biggest Irish ISP: Eircom; to use the three strikes rule and boot people off the Internet… No Judge, no Jury, no evidence of a crime.. Just an IP address and a sanction which you cannot contest.\nI have sent a poignant email to IRMA’s solicitor based on their letter of attack on the ISP’s. If you think any of the language is too harsh by me; please have a look at a sample of the threat letter this solicitor sent out here. This is a legal firm who were suing individuals for thousands of euro; which I would hazard a guess most couldn’t pay. So in my eyes this is a form of legal terrorism; and a joke letter to give this solicitor a heads up that there are people out there like me who read and know the tactics of the Irish Music Rights Organisation; and the parent companies like IFPI, RIAA and the Anit-Piracy Bureau they spring from…. It is my opinion that nothing short of punishment (jail time) for frivolous threat letters should be carried out, plus damages (x10 like they do in their cases) to individuals and companies wrongly stressed out by this. I will compile a blog post of all the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) that IRMA has spread soon; and a rebuttal of why their actions may even increase piracy. One thing is for sure; my analysis will be a whole lot cheaper (free) and probably more accurate!\nNote: I have taken out names, but the legal firm and the acting solicitor can be examined in the letter above ^\nDear [Solicitor for IRMA’s name],\nIt is my position that you are morally bankrupt through your actions via IRMA vs. ISP’s. If you need independent advice on how this technology works (I am in Computer Science; but I can explain things slowly; so who knows?) I would be most delighted to help. Please note my hourly rate is at least twice yours; but I’m worth it!\nI look forward to hearing from you in 7 days; lest I contact a credit agency for non-payment. As this email constitutes services rendered by me. But I am willing to trade for legal advice on disbarment of a solicitors firm I know which abuses the law; only because I am a reasonable person!\nKindest Regards \u0026 Love,\n[My Footer]\nPS: This is intended as Humour… only slightly…(joke!).

Being able to cajole and bribe the largest Irish Internet Service Provider (ISP) - Eircom; has worked only too well. Although Eircom has said it will only obey by having a court order - it has agreed never to oppose these - which makes it complicit in the act of censorship. My Letter to Our ISP, Eircom, IRMA, EFF:\nDear [OUR ISP],\nWe are a loyal customer of yours. We are writing this because we’re concerned about recent news regarding IRMA (Irish Music Rights Ass.) relationship with your company (the recent letters sent out).\nIt would seem that they are seeking to become self-appointed censors of Irish Internet communications. We do not think that a third-party company should be permitted to arbitrarily decide which Internet sites Eircom users; or more importantly any Irish Internet user should be allowed to visit. Will IRMA want to block sites that merely link to copyrightable material, proxy sites that circumvent the block, blogs that criticize its actions? This is a very slippery slope and should be nipped in the bud.\nIn the recent high profile case against The Pirate Bay in Sweden; IRMA’s handlers (IFPI, RIAA) have shown their hand: they don’t even understand the underlying technology. John Kennedy, CEO. IFPI:\nKennedy said he qualified as a lawyer since the 70’s but hasn’t practiced recently. He was asked if he understood BitTorrent. Kennedy said he did, but in “very vague terms.” When the defense lawyers asked more detailed questions, about uTorrent for instance, Kennedy said he’d heard of it but had no idea of the details. It was very clear he knew nothing about any remotely technical issues.\nThis is the the kind of people who wish to regulate the Internet. Questions need to be asked that if you follow IRMA’s requested actions does this open you up to legal action for any other kinds of material which rights holders are protective of (Church of Scientology) ? and can you retain common carrier status like An Post; and need warrants issued instead of some rights organisation sending you a vague letter pretending to represent XY\u0026Z ?\nWe understand the ‘concern’ about Internet piracy. Artists definitely need to be paid for their hard work. It is an important issue in this day and age, and it must be addressed correctly. Censorship is not the answer. It is avoiding the issue. As has always happened in these cases, it is normal customers who are inconvenienced and have their free speech restricted the most. We need solutions that work, not knee-jerk reactions that are doomed to fail. We recommend you read the EFF’s whitepaper on a better way forward for online music. http://www.eff.org/wp/better-way-forward-voluntary-collective-licensing-music-file-sharing\nThere are opportunities here that are being missed. I think it would be for the benefit of both artists and music fans if a solution could be found that combines the technologies developed by the pirates with a fair system for paying artists.\n**There was a very similar case in Italy where ISPs were forced to block The Pirate Bay’s website after pressure from the music industry (the result was that Italian traffic to the site increased by 5%) . The ban was judged illegal in court under European Directive, 2000/31 CE which is also applicable in Ireland. **\nIf this ban goes ahead, Eircom and indeed Ireland will have a tarnished image on the world stage as a place where misguided efforts to protect revenue supersede freedom of communication. We would also be strongly considering abandoning our Internet subscription for an ISP who doesn’t cave to these demands, and we imagine many other business’ will too.\nPlease, make the right choice. The world is watching. Your decision will have an important impact on the future of the Internet in Ireland.\nYours faithfully,\n[Footer]\nI will posting more on this issue as it happens.

Wikipedia defines it as:\nIn graphical computing, a desktop environment (DE) commonly refers to a style of graphical user interface …… A desktop environment typically consists of icons, windows, toolbars, folders, wallpapers, and desktop widgets. (See WIMP.)\nI would add a file manager and browser to this list also! Let’s look at the two most popular consumer Operating Systems (in three variants) and their Desktop Environments:\nOS Name Widgets Window Manager File Manager Browser Windows XP Luna Stack Window Manager Windows File Explorer Internet Explorer 6 Windows Vista Aero Desktop Window Manager Windows File Explorer Internet Explorer 7 Mac OS X Cocoa Quartz Compositor Finder Safari 2.X Now take Linux; really a Kernel, but packaged means an Operating System. Which way you package it makes all the difference! You still use the same drivers, the boot process is still the same, but when your machine finishes its boot and launches all that graphics stuff anything can appear: anything. It’s abstraction to have no real graphics in a kernel other than that which are drivers to control hardware. This is very strange to people who think in the Windows way (nb. I used to be one of these). At the end of Windows XP booting I have never seen anything but Luna; and most people don’t know its called that. So it is very strange for people my age and slightly older who grew up over DOS and Windows 3.1/95 line to have this fundamental shift in logic.\nWhen most people say Linux they ’never’ (as Home Desktop user) normally mean the Kernel; they mean ‘Gnome’, ‘KDE’, ‘Fluxbox’, ‘Enlightenment’ and I could go on! To confuse further; people who say Linux may mean ‘Ubuntu’, ‘Fedora’, ‘OpenSuse’, ‘Mandriva’ which are all packaged versions of Linux Kernel with a Desktop Environment such as Gnome or KDE (and GNU Toolkit). So here’s the table:\nDesktop Environment Widgets Window Manager File Manager Browser Gnome GTK2 Metacity Nautilus Firefox/ Ephiphany KDE QT KWin Dolphin/Konqueror Konqueror XFCE GTK Window Manager Thunar Midori\nThe interesting part… Yes there really was a point to all of this rambling! The point is the you are not bound to any graphical way in Linux:* there is none*. It is completely your choice what you choose to use. If you go with a pre-package distribution the choice is made: Ubuntu uses Gnome, Kubuntu uses KDE, and Xubuntu uses XFCE. The really neat part: all can co-exist happily on the same machine. I have KDE, Gnome and XFCE all installed right now. I can open up Konqueror in Gnome; Thunar in KDE and Epiphany in XFCE. All my KDE programs appear in my Gnome menu and vice-versa; same with XFCE. This is a strange concept from being able to use say Mac OS X Finder on Windows: it can’t be done! Open source plays nice ;) Now for the part I like; lovely screenshots to help you on your journey to choose!\nGnome 2.20 KDE 4 XFCE Enlightenment\nNB. I wrote this post as I noticed some in my Computer Science class struggled with this concept, in many ways I couldn’t understand this at first either… so I just thought what would normal people think? My response is this post; with a few screenshots to hopefully brighten things up! Wikipedia has a more in-depth comparison of X11 Linux-compatible Desktop environments here for those interested.\n","description":"","tags":["linux","software"],"title":"Linux Desktop Environments?","uri":"/linux-desktop-environments/"},{"content":"Last year was me celebrating four years of using the best operating system out there: Linux and the best distro Ubuntu. Ubuntu was my first foray in to Linux; and I haven’t left it since; although I have tried all the other major distros. I started with the first version of Ubuntu; Warthy Warthog:\nWarthy had a text only installer and it took me quite a while to not only get used to the idea of this strange operating system; but the fear of leaving Windows-land where all that power usage knowledge would mean nothing. It meant nothing in terms of the registry and other superficial stuff; but the more I used Ubuntu and Linux the more I liked it. In fact in 2005 I ditched my XP installation altogether. I noticed there wasn’t an Irish Ubuntu users group; so I mailed one of the few people (around 5 I guess) that were around Mark Shuttleworth to set it up and get a website going. It was an ill-advised effort since I was too busy with examinations really to take it on; so I gave it up soon after. But it is still going today, people are still involved.\nHoary Next came Hoary in 2005 and I was blown away how fast improvements were made; I still couldn’t believe all this could be free… It seemed too good to be true really; I thought if Mark Shuttleworth ever left that would finish off Ubuntu and that would be it. While that might be still true; other distributions out there do tremendous work: Fedora is one I’d use if there were no Ubuntu.\nAll I can say is this: while I was definitely interested in Information Technology before (and knew I was heading for a Computer Science course); I owe a lot to Linux and Ubuntu for showing me the nitty gritty (that I wanted to see) and has helped me immesureably in my College life. Of course now that Ubuntu is one of the most polished Linux distrobutions out there it helps me when I need to get away from the nitty gritty too ;) To end this post it is only fitting to see the latest version:\n","description":"","tags":["linux","software"],"title":"Ubuntu in four years","uri":"/ubuntu-in-four-years/"},{"content":"Recently I downloaded the Kubuntu packages of the new KDE 4.2 beta 2. For those of you who don’t know; KDE is the K Desktop Environment; which includes a window manager (KWin), common desktop applications, its own menu (Kickoff), browser (Konqueror), file manager (dolphin) etc. Basically it is the most popular desktop environment on Linux next to Gnome.\n*KDE 4.2 Beta 2 with Kickoff Menu visible\n**What is so special about KDE? **\nThe philosophy of KDE is the advanced configuration it allows through its Graphical User Interface (GUI), this is versus Gnome which chooses sane defaults and leaves configuration in hard to reach places and out-of-sight. This isn’t to say KDE doesn’t choose sane defaults; it does and is very user-friendly. KDE has always been the more Windows-like of the major desktop environments and this hasn’t really changed in KDE 4.X series. KDE is available in popular distributions of Linux such as Kubuntu, Mandriva, OpenSuse. The special part about 4.X series is that for the first time for any Linux desktop environment; it is fully cross-platform, easily installs and works on Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X.\nKDE 4.2 Panel; with KOrganizer calendar open\nWhats new in 4.2?\nStability. Ever since KDE started the really beautiful 4.X branch they have gotten harsh criticism for stability problems. This is not surprising as KDE 3.5 was the result of years of bugfixing and stability fixes and was really rock solid stable; in fact I don’t remember it crashing at all in the times I used it; but I have been a Gnome user for a while. This criticism was deserved; but perhaps premature: KDE always stated this almost ground-up rewrite of everything major wasn’t going to be pretty and it wasn’t. I used KDE 4.0 and KDE 4.1 and both crashed frequently; especially Plasma since it powers almost everything on the desktop.\nDesktop Effects\nWith this release comes the introduction of desktop effects; if your graphics card is supported. I think this is a great move since projects like Compiz required hacked in dectection of KDE or Gnome and I suspect this was coded in; it really makes sense to have desktop effects in the core; as it will really help stabilise them as the KDE4.X branch matures.\n*\n*\nBetter Customisation\nYou can now control height and length of the menu bar; as well as add many more plasma applets to it. The Kmenu replacement Kickoff has stepped up to the plate in this release and features almost a complete set of icons for any application (much to my chargrin in earlier release a lot of ? icons could be seen). Also more customisation and preference panes of Plasmoids are allowed.\nDesktop Effects in KDE 4.2 Beta 2\nFull major feature overview is here.\nSo whats the final assessment?\nWhen this is released I definately recommend you try it! This is the first release of the 4.X branch I would be happy to install and support on my family’s desktop. Since I don’t often get to access it physically to fix problems; this is one area I couldn’t trust either 4.0 or 4.1 to behave. It still isn’t as feature-completed or as stable as 3.5 series; but in my opinion it is damn close and approaching fast; get it while its hot!!\nKubuntu Instructions to get KDE 4.2 Beta 2 on Kubuntu Intrepid 8.10\n","description":"","tags":["linux","software","review"],"title":"KDE 4.2 Beta 2","uri":"/beta-2/"},{"content":"I downloaded Firefox 3.1 beta 2 (after trialling other development snapshots over the last few months) to see Ogg Theora video support is coming on really well. Opera, as well as Mozilla has committed to including this royalty-free video codec for web use. This is really good news; as one Opera Developer said:\nSomething however is still not quite there about web video. The video solutions mentioned above are proprietary closed solutions that rely on plugins to display in a web page - what we need to make video a first-class web citizen is an easy, open solution to integrate video into web pages, and native support for video in browsers.\nIn short, we need a \u003c video \u003e element in HTML, and we must also agree on a baseline video format that will be universally supported, just like the GIF, JPEG and PNG image formats are universally supported for images. It’s important that the video format we choose can be supported by a wide range of devices and that it’s royalty-free (RF). RF is a well-established principle for W3C standards. The Ogg Theora format is a promising candidate, which has been chosen by Wikipedia.\nSo all that basically means that video should be a first class citizen of the web like images. For too long has it been wrapped up in Flash and Silverlight. They could still wrap ogg theora and degrade nicely if no plugin for their format is detected (dependent on Adobe and Microsoft which is unlikely).

I do own a PS3 (amazing hardware I might add) and I prefer FPS and generally devious natured video games (like the GTA franchise). Does that make me a bad person who wants to kill people? Of course not; nothing could be further from the truth. But some people stick their fingers in their ears and shout “LA LA LA Columbine LALALA Terrorists LALALA Violent Video Games!”. They say it is destructive to childrens young precious minds. The “Think of The Children” argument always disgusted me; its like shouting Fire in a packed room when their is no danger: it is false, just to garner attention and a sickening twisted version of the facts. Are violent video games harmful to kids? Probably; I wouldn’t advocate giving them access since they; just like movies are clearly rated for Adults. * *\nWhat is so hard to understand about that? Its is clearly an issue of parenting and morals whether you allow your child access to such material. So it is clear the real issue is the lack of proper guidance by parents; either to not bother enforcing the ratings, block their children from receiving them as gifts, or monitor to check if they spend pocket money on such items. They gladly do so for other adult items like adult content, movies, cigarettes and alcohol; why not video games? Today’s consoles even have ratings built-in (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360) which are enforceable by a password the parent can set. This makes it a breeze to block adult games and really hard for the average child (never mind adult) to circumvent. They could still play it at a friends house of course; you can’t lock your children down, but even so you can actively limit their exposure to such material. The study points out what others and I have always known: Video games don’t corrupt a mind by themselves, other factors (mainly social/upbringing) have a much bigger impact (Highlighting mine for brevity):\nResearch at Smith \u0026 Jones seems to imply that feelings of anger and powerlessness often pre-exist a compulsion to play violent games. In some cases these people find each other in the gaming world and form a bond based on those feelings of alienation and anger.\nMr Bakker believes that if there was more commitment from parents and other care givers to listen to what their children are saying then these issues of isolation and frustration could be dealt with at source and bring many young people out of the virtual world and back into real life.\n“If I continue to call gaming an addiction it takes away the element of choice these people have,” he says. “It’s a complete shift in my thinking and also a shift in the thinking of my clinic and the way it treats these people.”\nMr Bakker sees a time when addiction centres like Smith \u0026 Jones could close down if parents and adults in the community took more responsibility for the habits of their children. “In most cases of compulsive gaming, it is not addiction and in that case, the solution lies elsewhere.” - Courtesy BBC News\n","description":"","tags":["internet"],"title":"Research proves video games lack harm","uri":"/research-proves-video-games-lack-harm/"},{"content":"**Note: This Guide was written for use by my Computer Science class on Linux (and Mac OS X where noted).

I think it’s very important to catch up on the latest news; as I think you are more informed and have conversation pieces to talk to people (for those awkward silences where “Ye the weather is terrible” just won’t do). So I was highly informed when I read this piece: DCU head hits out at ‘out-of-date’ O’Keeffe.\n“There is a tension between the traditional expectation that universities will primarily teach students, and the more recent requirement for universities to underpin economic development and attract corporate research and development into Ireland . . . not to mention the role of universities as agencies of cultural regeneration and of tackling disadvantage and structural poverty,” said Prof von Prondzynski.\nI couldn’t agree more. I think it is disgraceful that students who try to improve themselves; their standard of living and their community by getting a great education are penalised with higher fees. The equal access to education that the state is trying to promote will be further harmed by an increase in fees. It is [relatively] cheap to go to college as it is; and still the economic underclass are under-represented.\nNothing is for free don’t get me wrong… But these students turn in to some of the hardest and most innovative workers in the world; and most get a really good salary to match; which means they pay the most tax on average of any socio-economic class. People in the super-rich category can afford to off-shore; not so for these professional people. People in the lowest socio-economic classes pay the standard rate of 20% as they’d earn under the average industrial wage (about 30,000) and rightly so. So that just leaves the ‘higher’ if-you-will middle class (although all terms are relative; I don’t agree with the labels personally); which pay disproportionate amount. So the Governments policy seems to discourage many of these people from actually educating themselves and getting a good job.

Maybe I should write to Batt O’Keefe and remind him what research gets you… Just in the Tech field alone (which I know most about); research is everything. The Internet? Check, American Military Research (Arpanet). The Web? Check, CERN Particle Physics Laboratory. Graphical Interfaces? Check, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).

I mean as my previous posts mention I have moved to Kilkenny; and rural South Kilkenny at that. They live and breath Hurling down here: it’s literally a way of life. That is why they are so good; no mystery here folks: its is literally bred into children in schools and everyone plays it. More people playing means even though Kilkenny is only around 100,000 people it still has a large amount of people to pick from and they get the best training which equals the best results.\nThe City’s mayor Pat Crotty said (paraphrased as I read it and cannot find the quote): “People say Kilkenny winning all the time is bad for hurling, not with displays like that”. That is referring to the utter decimation of the county that adjoins South Kilkenny: Waterford. They were beaten by the biggest scoreline in over 50 years I think it was; yes it was a savage display. I speak as a Kildare man from a county that has achieved little to no success (sorry lads lets face facts!); and I wish they would emulate Kilkenny’s prowess and agility. The press raved about how it was the best display of Hurling this century. As things go I was working; but the vibe was unreal. I was also working when over 25,000 people showed up to greet them home.\nAnyways in South Kilkenny where my folks live is called Danesfort; and to prove how into Hurling they are they even have a song (bear in mind this is not a town or village; its basically a pub, church and houseS with less than 80 people living here); proof if it’s needed Kilkenny are mental about Hurling:\n","description":"","tags":["sport"],"title":"Hurling - Four in a row?","uri":"/hurling-four-in-row/"},{"content":"I just read one of the most informative and insightful blog posts of my entire life.

It’s Ireland’s smallest city and home to Ireland’s very first Parliament about 400 years ago: Kilkenny.

Okay I’ll get this out of the way: I had a Frappacino in Starbucks and I’m a student; so not too poor of a student ;)\nBut I saw the inside of Brown Thomas for the first time. I don’t shop for fashion at all: but what I found was the kind of vulgarity and fake-ness I’d expect of London or New York; not Dublin. To paraphrase Bono: “In America if you have your mansion on a hill people look up to you and think ‘I want to be like him and afford a house like that one day’; if you have the same mansion in Ireland people say ’look at the fucken eejit on the hill with that house; thinks he’s god or sumthen’” and that to me was always an endearing part of Irish culture; people around you being the great leveller if you thought you were the bomb. Inside BT (Brown Thomas) was all the names you’d expect; all the major names more at home in Paris, London or New York. I confronted my friend who was showing me round about my opinions (in my usual polite manner: just say it). To my surprise he agreed 110%. Yes he said: for the people who buy this stuff can tell who else is wearing it; and I think he meant that by this logic movers and shakers also wore all the brands to look the part. Soon after he told me he was also learning Golf because he knew it would be a great benefit for his future career: “All important people also play golf” he assured me.\nI see this divide in society and I admit it bothers me. Where I go to College, there is an estate across the road which is by any standards not had the full benefit of the Celtic Tiger (the Irish Boom Economy). I get the bus from this place and everytime it bothers me that I see some social problems: everything from unruly kids trying to ruin the place to alcholics. But I also have people in my class from that estate: some of the nicest you’d ever care to meet. I’ve been asked by them my opinion on where they live and what do I think other people think.\nThen comes my home town. It is on the border of Dublin (city) and Kildare (farmers and horsebreeders) and we’ve got a mix of both. But Leixlip is decidedly middle class; low enough crime; not much social tension to be heard of; certainly nowhere near the likes of South Dublin (seen as upper class) or North Dublin (seen as lower class).

Ebay has already written down the value of Skype as a large loss on their purchase price of $2.6 billion in stock and cash. But would Skype’s G-branded future be any better?\nI think it would be. Skype is a strong international brand for voice calls, instant messaging and video calls; but of course it competes directly with Google Talk. Skype as a company has made a lot of mistakes; but they actually produces some of the best technology for p2p VOIP out there in the marketplace. Skype is particularly strong in redundancy, cost of network operation (since it’s p2p every user carries’ each others traffic; most people have no idea of this fact) and routing around the most draconian network admins out their through their routers.\nAll of this is a strict propreitary network and is centrally controlled at the moment for Ebay. All voice is encrypted accross Skype; but it is well-speculated that Skype has a back door to snoop on anyone it so wishes (although it would never publicly admit to this). Legislation hasn’t caught up to protect voice calls like they are on “traditional” PSTN [Pretty Simple Telephone Network].\nI think Google could open up Skype’s network; to what extent is anyone’s guess. I hope they integrate XMPP like Gmail Chat capability (which is an open standard); and do the same for voice/video (could take a while based on patents) . I predict the client will most likely stay propreitary and closed-source; as opening it up could reveal back-doors; patent and copyright issues and more.

I am a staunch supporter of the European project; or at least the ideals it is based on to create a peaceful, demcratic union of countries with a common background and share similiar goals. Intrigued by the article I read it only to find out that a local man who used to represent my area was responsible. I had to write to him to ask how he lost his mind….\nDear Mr. McCreevy;\nI am writing to you from Kildare. You have served our county over the years; and I even thought you would become Taoiseach (Prime Minister of Ireland) one day (being the Minister for Finance is a front-runner position- let’s be honest) but then you went to Europe.\nBut that’s not the subject of this correspondence. I am writing to you to voice my disgust for your proposed levies and taxes in conjunction with an even longer copyright extension. What are you thinking Mr. McCreevy? The average musician does not live for 95 years. I am responding to points made by you in the International Herald Tribune (Original article: AP Newswire; Published 14/02/2008) and the legislation proposed at your level in the commission (through which you will have direct influence).\nYour Misguided view of copyright: “If nothing is done, thousands of European performers who recorded in the late 1950s and 1960s will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next ten years,” said EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, the union’s internal market chief. “These royalties are often their sole pension.”\nI don’t know about you Mr. McCreevy; but I will have to set aside money from my earnings for my pension;. why shouldn’t artists? Copyright is supposed to encourage innovation; not reward old creations. Copyright on these works should have rightfully expired on these a long time ago; forcing these musicians to create more music we all love and enjoy, instead of idly collecting money for work done sometimes as much as fifty years ago. These Musicians were already paid for their works a long time ago; and they signed it over to a [record] company. You are only enriching a company that contributes zero cultural value back by extending a copyright term. This has been proven time and time again if you would do your research.\nExtra Copies / Levies The EU executive also wants to look again at reforming copyright levies charged on blank discs, data storage and music and video players to compensate artists and copyright holders for legal copying when listeners burn an extra version of an album to play one at home and one in the car.\nWhy should as a consumer I have to pay twice for a music recording? You know this will only have the effect of driving up the cost of a CD and increasing piracy? “You can’t charge me twice if I choose to pirate it!”; and this is how a lot of consumers will see it; like double tax evasion only easier with less risk! You must recognise also that the music collection agencies are run by cartels that is the music industry (Big Four: SonyBMG, Warner, EMI, Universal ) which is almost never fair to artists? (Look at SoundExchange in the United States for this). What about when I use disks for backup of my data (which is the only reason I use them for) why should I pay royalties for music I never pirated? How also can you tell which artists deserves more royalties than the next? You can’t; and that is why this idea is so stupid you should put it to bed now!\nWho it benefits? The extension would not benefit only stars such as French crooner Charles Aznavour or British pop star Cliff Richard, McCreevy said. Session musicians who played on a recording would also be able to draw on a new fund.\nAh-ha-ha-ha You see Mr. Mc.Creevy case in point! These men actually own; or have very liberal licensing terms with their record companies; allowing them in the first place to be spokespeople for longer copyright terms. The same cannot be said for the vast majority of artists; who don’t have that luxury. Please remind me what exactly these men have contributed to society musically in the last few years? Oh riiiiiight; thats nothing; zero; zilch! What about others of that era? Elvis? dead and buried! Beatles? no longer around! and I could go on and on and on about how they are literally getting money for nothing….. The only beneficiary will be the record companies who own the recordings to 70’s and 80’s material which is lucrative (for this see Michael Jackson owning some of the Beatles catalogue).\nMy plea to you is to stop this insanity and work towards less copyright restriction not more. Copyright was originally designed to safeguard an original author to make back the time and the effort he/she put into the creation which benefitted society (ie. compensation usually in the form of monetary gain). With this understanding it’s plain to see these people have long since got back many times the creative energy they put in and societies debt to them has long since passed.\nRegards,\nYour former constituent;\nN Grogan\n14/02/2008\nP.S. I am eagerly awaiting you reply and any comments you have on what I have said…\nI got a reply from someone in the commissioners office (I have removed the name); better than nothing but I’d still like to hear from him on the matter…. Anyway here it is:\nDear Mr Grogan,\nThank you for your e-mail of 14 February concerning the term of protection for sound recordings.\nThe Commissioner has noted your most interesting comments.

The amarok team are busy porting it from it’s UNIX underpinnings to Windows and OS X.\nWhats to like about Amarok then?\nalso is cool phonetically: am a rock!\nAlbum covers in full glory (see picture right) Full lyrics support; even for the most obscure songs you have laying around! Wikipedia integration: truly a gem; you can do what Amarok says “Rediscover your Music” in looking up artist, song or album in the free encyclopedia. Playlists form the backone of the player; great for people like me who like to compile sub-sections of songs for car journeys and the like! Smart playlists: you get playlists which can update based on how your rate them; which artist or what genre; sorting conditions ar infinite! Example is a 5 Star playlisat with all my top rated tunes! Dynamic playlists: built from your static and smart playlists; it can show the last X songs you played and Y upcoming. So I could select my 5 star faves and my Strokes favourites; set it to show 5 last played songs and 15 upcoming. I never need to edit the playlist again as it will auto choose and update the list! Statistics: Show all your stats on your collection! From favourite artists to most played albums: it’s all there waiting! Last.fm \u0026 Tags: Tag and compiles your music listening tastes with integration in the most popular social music site online! IPod integration is second to none (as well as many 0ther popular players!)! Amarok will convert it to mp3; sync podcasts and playlists; transfer ratings and even submit listened tracks to last.fm! All the added extras: Equaliser with presets; Random and Repeat capability; Visualisations! You can even sort you collection by mood with Moodbar installed! Scripts!?! One of the coolest thing is scripts: think Firefox extensions only slightly more powerful! Built-in editing of song names; album names and all info! Don’t bother telling Amarok to add the music you just ripped; as long as it’s in your music folder its automatically picked up and added! An intuitive interface: built for function and power: Amarok is almost perfect in its balance between feature and function. The OSD )On-Screen Display) with show you any details your playlist does; like Artist Name; Album name; Rating and how long a track is!

It wasn’t expected for Nokia to introduce an upgrade to the N800 Internet Tablet (which I also reviewed here) so soon. I certainly don’t envy the position of a small team getting the hardware and software for a mini-computer right in such a short space of time. But needless to say the N810 feels right; in fact it feels more right than the N770 which I thought had the best design of all (be it functionality not so much style). The N810 has bags of style; in a flashy brand-new-car sort of way; it looks expensive and I believe Nokia plays to this in their pricing.\nWell the best new feature has to be the operating system: OS 2008. It is clean; stable enough and illustrates beautifully in a Apple Mac sort of way when hardware and software are matched beautifully you get an unrivaled product. But that runs on N800 also; so why bother with the N810? GPS is inbuilt for one; but the mapping software is pretty horrible. Luckily the Open Source MaemoMapper is the original (and still the best) GPS program for any maemo platform (OS 2007, OS 2006). No offence to WayFinder but their software isn’t ideal and feels like a shabby port to the Internet Tablets; like it was ripped off another device and thrown at Nokia’s devices. Nokia also dropped the ball in other areas; such as keylocking and the home applets: home applets are little bubbles of information you immeadiatly see on the N810’s home screen. The problem you ask? The move (by design; older OS ones were fixed) and the keylock made to keep them stable is not functional as I believe it could be. Why can’t I set an auto screen lock when I flip the keyboard back in? That kind of commission is what I’d call a ‘schoolboy error’.\nApps make any device and the N810 has a few good ones; but nothing totally wow or killer just yet. Skype as many people are aware is semi-included in the device (after a download) and as of yet unlike its desktop Linux counterpart; it lacks full video support (on a device with a decent vga webcam camera\nno sense here!). There is also full GoogleTalk integration; with SIP support coming up (perhaps with full video on SIP; maybe as of yet with GoogleTalk if they adopt SIP?). Other than that great apps include FBreader a great Windows/Linux ebook reader; and some fun pass the time games like TuxPuck, IceBreaker and LXDoom can be downloaded. What about the apps included I hear you ask? Well the Web Browser is quality from Mozilla and far outshines the Opera browser which graced both the N770 and N800. Updates are not really noticeable in the core non-essential apps like Email (an awful excuse for an email client), RSS reader (decent enough) and Filemanager. To the core I suspect they made a bevy of changes; but I’m not that hardcore so I’ll skip technical details like that; needless to say its startup time was reduced; battery life seems longer; and it feels more responsive on OS 2008. So should I buy it? If you don’t have a N800 I would say definitely go for it; as long as you think the price is right. As with any tech device; shop around for a bargain on the price over Nokia’s retail listed price. Who is it aimed at? People in college like me who like to keep in touch with friends; read their pdfs docs; and cringe to be away from some sort of connectivity. This also applies to business users who would have similar uses with clients; but unfortunately the necessity of a second device in non-wifi connected areas kills this devices true potential until Nokia decides to inbuild 3G or Wimax.\n","description":"","tags":["hardware","review"],"title":"A few days with A Nokia N810","uri":"/few-days-with-nokia-n810/"},{"content":"Apple does it again: explosive growth in the computer market, no doubt in part to its Macbook/Macbook Pro line of laptops.

These numbers also continue the company’s trend of steadily gaining market share every two quarters for at least the past year.\nHere’s the graph of the figures:\nIs it the most popular desktop UNIX? No, as until Leopard comes out it is not officially a UNIX stamped and sealed POSIX compliant system; but then again neither is Linux.

That doesn’t include SuSe, Red Hat, Slackware, Debian, Mandriva and other popular distributions, which means Linux has most likely a bigger install base, although Apple is gaining ground fast. As Rob Malda (founder of popular geek news site: Slashdot) said:\nLinux will have a strong position on the server for a long time, but as GNOME and KDE bickered with each other, Apple came along and gave the world a great desktop UNIX.

The one feature it will emit is an inbuilt FM Radio, which was axed to make the N810 a smaller tablet.

This is all about multiple workspaces that can hold various graphical user elements, a Xerox Parc patent which dates to the early 1990’s. Xerox Palo Alto Research center invented the graphical user interface in the 1980’s, only to been, licensed and used by Steve Jobs in Mac OS Classic. Now IP Innovation, a submarine patent troll, who make no products and bought the patent want their payday. The logical step is to go after the biggest infringer to set a precedent for your patent, and then make your way to all the smaller companies who infringe. Well logically of course that would be Apple or Microsoft. Apple has already paid them a reported 20 million dollars, and well no-one knows what Microsoft has done, but this fish is smelly. From the Register Article:\nThe complaint, available here as a pdf, says “the Red Hat Linux system, the Novell Suse Linux Enterprise Desktop and the Novell Suse Linux Enterprise Server all breach held patents. The companies seek increased damages for the willful infringements of their patents and an injunction to prevent further infringements”.\nSo we already know they bought a patent thats years old, are patent trolls, they extorted money from Apple and Microsoft appears to have no dealings with them. But wait! We see Steve Ballmer (Microsoft’s CEO) saying recently Linux should have to pay like Microsoft does in the “IP Regime”. Regime always seemed a rather nasty word to me, something your forced to put up with - like Robert Mugabes regime in Zimbabwe; come to think of it Steve, I would have said that exact same thing - a dirty rotten evil patent regime - but thats not what you meant. You meant you wanted a cut for every Linux support contract and if its free like Ubuntu - well though, you want money anyway. Steve you claim innovation Microsoft produced is in Linux, but refuse to show any evidence. Your bold statements which could be considered illegal under Sarbanes-Oxley in the United States hasn’t stopped you. But a patent lawsuit has, you know it will destroy Microsoft and can never kill Linux- maybe Linux business but you’d settle for that (If we can’t make money off it, no one can!). Now we have a patent troll, and Open Source legal resources Groklaw has exposed it to employ Microsoft employees who specialise in patents. We are well aware as a community you have a hand in this - how much remains to be seen. The community warned you through the Open Invention network ( a patent clearinghouse which vows to protect open source through pooled patents by Sony, HP, IBM, Google, Phillips, Novell, Oracle, Red Hat and others) and a petition of thousands of people to put up or shut up about patents. Now you have released SCO II when we are done killing off the first one\nthrough copyrights - now its patents. Well we are not going to stand for this any more; I am hoping Red Hat and Novell stand strong and fight this; and I hope the lawyers at the Open Invention Network and the Software Freedom Law center seriously consider a pre-emptive attack on you.

Granted the iPod would have been a huge success probably still, but OS X’s core is the foundation for the real money making Apple will do over the next few years, a point that is not lost on Mr. Jobs as the company intelligently markets different segments to different markets of which I have first hand experience of: Go to the Apple site for education and they extol the brilliance of a Macbook and make they deal sweeter by throwing in an iPod Nano. But if you go to a link I was provided in a college advert; they bring to a page pointing out key areas a mac can make a difference. I picked Computer Science naturally, and the site extolled the virtues of Open Source, a Unix base and programming tools like Xcode.\nSo whats the big deal? Well the fact the new iPods are locked solid with a new encrypted hash, meaning nothing besides iTunes will work with the new iPods. The iPhone also gets similar treatment, no third party development is allowed: no only Apple Applications are allowed. This stinks to high heavens of monopolistic behavior akin to Microsoft or IBM of old. Not to mention gouging both networks and customers with the iPhone. Apple may not yet be important enough to endure the wrath of the European Union Antitrust bodies or the US Department of Justice; but they are certainly on a slippery slope as the popularity of their products and lock in seem to increase day by day. Interestingly enough Apple may be also feeling the heat of Linux, with the much-famed poster child of the free software revolution now making it into Apple’s marketing material; meaning Apple sees Linux as a future threat. After taking so much from Open Source, including the GNU Tool chain, the BSD Kernel, the Samba Networking protocols to interact with Windows (to name a few) Apple should be a good free software citizen and not aggravate core customers like myself of which Open source is a key factor in OS X.\n","description":"","tags":["apple","legal"],"title":"Apple - Play Nice....","uri":"/apple-play-nice/"},{"content":"This is the guy who runs Stanford University Undergraduate programme.

Chapters are as follows:\nIntroducing Ubuntu Installing Ubuntu Using Ubuntu on the Desktop Advanced Usage and Managing Ubuntu Ubuntu Server Support / Typical Problems Using Kubuntu Ubuntu Community Ubuntu-Related Projects Using Edubuntu This book is a very complete introduction and contains suprising elements related to finding out and joining the community of users - which you will not find in other Ubuntu Books (such as O’Reilly’s Ubuntu Hacks) which make it a unique and worthwhile addition to any Ubuntu users personal library. It is most helpful to new users to Ubuntu, which sections on installing and help with problems that could be faced. Having said that, it falls short on the amount of truly unique information that it contains - most of the books contents can be found on the web. What you are paying for is a well-laid out, well written account of the Ubuntu-sphere and all that goes along with it.\nThe price of €37.50 which I paid (less in the US, about $34.99 RRP) might be a bit much for some, but when you consider the operating system itself is free, you can easily justify the cost. A DVD comes included with the book which contains Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu, rather handy if you do not want to download the cd image.\nThe Server section is obviously a bit more for the advanced user, but still is a quint introduction to the basics which is 34 pages long - probably not enough to warrant a purchase by a sever administrator or other power server user. The Edubuntu section offers an introduction to the school-based flavour of Ubuntu which tips on how they differ and administration of multiple machines (including a nice introduction to thin clients and servers for schools).\nWhos the book for?\nPeople new to Ubuntu, people moving from Windows, School Administrators all fit the test case. If your an Ubuntu power user, don’t mind taking down your system or messing with the kernel than you should stick to online help. However I bought the book to show to others and promote Ubuntu as a viable and successful alternative to Mac OS X and Windows - it gives a great impression of the project and it’s success to date and I also bought it to support Ubuntu financially.\nMy Rating: 8.5/10\n","description":"","tags":["book","review"],"title":"Review of the Official Ubuntu Book, Second Edition (2007)","uri":"/review-of-official-ubuntu-book-second/"},{"content":"I have got a place in a 4 year Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computing, or more commonly known as Computer Science (or comp sci as I am lazy and like to abbreviate).

Here's my tips!","uri":"/have-you-got-viruses-or-spyware-heres/"},{"content":"\nI recently read a very insightful article on 7 factors every company should seriously consider about Microsoft Windows, here they are summarised:\nLicensing Costs Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating systems and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of money on licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S. companies overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software maintenance in 2007.\nHardware Costs “You need to throw lots of hardware at it,” says Central Desktop founder Arnulf Hsu about Windows. The minimum hardware requirements for Server 2003 call for a Pentium III 550MHz, 512MB of RAM, and at least a 3GB hard drive. Linux, on the other hand, can go on an old Pentium II with only 64MB of RAM and 1GB of hard drive space.\nInefficient Security Control It’s going to take more labor to keep a Windows system secure. Virus makers and crackers target Windows systems because it is easier to break into.\nHeavy Vendor Influence Because so many corporations have a company policy that specifies “Microsoft-only,” it discourages independent thinking and technological savvy; many end up simply relying on the sales guy to tell them what applications they need.\nInefficient use of Manpower While it is true that it is relatively easy to find Windows-skilled IT admins, it’s still not exactly cheap. Though many Unix-based admins are more expensive, it takes fewer of them to maintain more servers, which saves money in the long run.\nFeature Lock-in Proprietary systems like Windows are not easily customizable. Companies that need the flexibility to drop in or remove features on an as-needed basis find themselves either paying for unneeded feature bloat, starving for the features they do need because commercial vendors rarely are willing to drop everything to accommodate a one-off request\nForced Upgrade Path With Microsoft, you’re on a forced upgrade path. Once it drops support on your version of Windows, you’re out of luck when it comes to fixing those above mentioned security holes-if you can even continue to use that version.\nThefull article on CIO is here, and is a very interesting read (it expands on the points I quoted above). No person in a company responsible for IT should go without reading this, especially if your are a “Microsoft-Only” shop.\n","description":"","tags":["microsoft","windows"],"title":"Seven financial reasons not to use Windows","uri":"/seven-financial-reasons-not-to-use/"},{"content":"HP it seems is responding to Dell’s initiative to sell Ubuntu on their computers. With the Ubuntu Dells reportedly selling very well and Dell rolling out the program worldwide, this hasn’t escaped the notice of the world’s number one computer manufacturer - HP. This is speculation from blogs that has been going on for months since Dell started to offer Ubuntu. The Direct to Dell Blog states:\nThis recent post from Tom Dryer caught my eye a couple of days ago, and thought I’d comment on it here. If the rumors about HP offering Ubuntu are true, we’re glad to see other vendors join us in support of Ubuntu and open source. We welcome HP and other system vendors that want to join in this initiative.\nThis is very good news indeed and I am glad Dell is being very receptive to the idea, they even made this humorous video about their new foray into Open Source:\nUbuntu Home Server is a newly announced project by Ubuntu community members to compete with Windows Home Server. Personally I think Microsoft is barking up the wrong tree with this, I don’t think many home users will bother with this type of product, maybe it will take off in a couple of years, but most people are not tech-savvy, and even if they are, chances are there already doing this with Linux, Xbox360 or a PS3. Many people can’t tell me even what a server is, never mind what it can do. Also it won’t make sense because people expect to have everything on their pc ready to go, and to not have to purchase another one to throw in a storage closet. Nevertheless to paraphrase Bill Gates and Steve Jobs at D5 Conference: We Built things we wanted to have. So in that tone and considering the Home server product is just modified Windows (it would not cost as much as say a whole new project like Zune or Xbox 360), I can see where Microsoft is betting that this is one of many avenues in the future. Personally I think it will be specialised hardware devices that will win this space, like Intel VIIV, Apple TV or one of the many consoles I mentioned.\n","description":"","tags":["linux"],"title":"HP to Follow Dell into Open Source? and Ubuntu Home Server","uri":"/hp-to-follow-dell-into-open-source/"},{"content":"After reading a nice article written by Jeff Jones, a security researcher for Microsoft. He says he isn’t biased, saying he worked over 75% of his career outside Microsoft, using Slackware Linux, Unix, HP Unix etc. He claims Windows Vista has less security holes than popular versions of Linux, such as Ubuntu (he also compares Red Hat, Novell, Mac OS X). First let me say why his facts are distorted, and why he knows his facts are distorted. His facts do raise an issue of slow patching of vulnerabilities across the software Industry, but Linux performs the best consistently because anyone can audit the code. Here’s why his comparisons are uneven:\nLinux is open source, so various tools can be used to find vulnerabilities. We don’t have this luxury with Windows, any holes found are needles in a haystack, but the target of the Windows monopoly allows greater incentive to find these needles Linux has used SUDO and ROOT users properly since its inception (Think of Administrator in Windows). Anyone who is not a root user on Linux cannot install programs, make system wide changes, and you can even stop them from using USB keys, CD Drives etc if you are paranoid. Now this has received much attention, Vista has retroactively inserted this kind of security, but by my experience, it is very obtrusive, and can be switched off. Root in Linux is alot harder to stop, and theres no graphical way to do it, so the average user won’t. A link to my second point above, Programs in Linux can only access what they need to, the home folder of the user that is running it and very little else. I don’t know what the case is in Vista, but in Windows XP, almost any program could destroy your system, by picking at the much famed registry. He provides pretty graphs, let me provide my own:\n(click on Graphs to Enlarge)\nAs you can see, Ubuntu Linux 7.04 (released April) compares comparatively better to Vista, available since January. The Graphs are provided by Secunia, an independent security research firm. Microsoft often downplays vulnerabilities other companies like Secunia find, which is also a factor that Jeff Jones did not mention (maybe he forgot?). I forget where this famous quote comes from but I have paraphrased: “You cannot depend on a man understanding a problem if his salary depends on him not understanding it”, which I think affects Mr. Jeff Jones.\n","description":"","tags":["windows","linux"],"title":"Windows Vista Security - Better than Linux?","uri":"/windows-vista-security-better-than/"},{"content":"After reading about Tom Cruise being banned from filming at certain German military sites because of his belief in Scientology, I was a bit outraged at first, despite my abhorrence of their beliefs, which I think are crazy and nonsensical.\nGermany has barred the makers of a movie about a plot to kill Adolf Hitler from filming at German military sites because its star Tom Cruise is a Scientologist, the Defence Ministry said on Monday. Cruise, also one of the film’s producers, is a member of the Church of Scientology which the German government does not recognise as a church. Berlin says it masquerades as a religion to make money, a charge Scientology leaders reject.\nSo far this seems very unreasonable from the the German Government, to target a faith based group like that, akin to the Jews perhaps? No, it is not that at all, Scientology are part of Holocaust denial and masquerading, blaming it (the Holocaust) on Psychologists. Germany is just enforcing its rights as a state to use its own systems of law, and its right to debar anyone whom they see as unfit from entering the country. If Mr. Cruise was a German citizen, this case would be different, he most likely would end up in jail like Neo-Nazis do. Is this unjustified? No I don’t think so, although the reporting of it is unclear at best and confuses people. The German Ministry does not wish to persecute Mr. Cruise, but as he is a member of an organization who break a law going back even before L. Ron Hubbard created the myth of Scientology, a post-World War II law.\nWhat is the picture above you may ask? Well that is the “Threats to Democracy”, a picture taken in Nuremburg, Germany (Photo Credit: Caesura). Once the bastion of hate that was the Nuremburg Rallies of WWII, it lists (left to right) Islamic Extremism, Scientology and Organised Crime as the biggest threats Western Democracy faces in the 21st Century, and I couldn’t agree more.

Here are some of the features:\nTime Machine: an automated backup utility which allows the user to restore files that have been deleted or replaced by another version of a file. Front Row currently only available with the purchase of a new Mac, but will be included with Leopard. It has been reworked to closely resemble the interface used by the Apple TV. Photo Booth, currently only available with the purchase of a new Mac, but will be included with Leopard. Spaces: an implementation of “virtual desktops” (individually called “spaces”), allowing users to have multiple desktops per user and be able to place certain applications and windows in a desktop. Users can organize certain Spaces for certain applications (i.e., one for work-related tasks and one for entertainment) and switch between them. Exposé will work inside Spaces, allowing the user to see at a glance all desktops on one screen.[9]) Spotlight incorporates additional search capabilities such as Boolean operators, as well as the ability to search other computers (with permissions). Redesigned Finder: a redesigned Finder based on iTunes 7. New Desktop: a redesigned desktop, which is comprised of a redesigned 3-D dock which uses a new feature called Stacks, as well as a new menu-bar which adapts itself to the desktop so menu-bar text is easily readable. Quick Look This allows documents to be viewed without actually opening them in an external application. Universal access: significant improvements to applications including VoiceOver, along with increased support for Braille, closed captioning and a new text-to-speech engine. Enhancements to Mail including the additions of RSS feeds, Stationery, Notes, and to-dos. To-dos use a system-wide service that is available to all applications. Dashboard enhancements, including Webclip, a feature that allows users to turn a part of any web page into a live Dashboard widget, and Dashcode to help developers code widgets.[14] iChat enhancements, including multiple logins, animated icons, and tabbed chats, similar to features present in Pidgin, Adium and the iChat plugin Chax; iChat Theater, allowing users to incorporate images from iPhoto, presentations from Keynote, and videos from QuickTime into chats; and Backdrops, which are similar to chroma keys, but use a real-time difference matte technique which does not require a green or blue screen. iChat will also implement desktop sharing, a feature previously available with Apple Remote Desktop.[15][16][17] Enhancements to Parental controls include the ability to place restrictions on use of the Internet and to set parental controls from anywhere using remote setup. iCal calendar sharing and group scheduling. Leopard will also include the software assistant known as Boot Camp, which has been available as a beta release download for Mac OS X v10.4 from Apple’s website since April 5, 2006.This assists the installation of Windows XP or Windows Vista to a separate partition (or separate internal drive) on Intel-based Macs. Menu Bar The new menu bar is now transparent and is no longer rounded like all previous Mac OS versions. Safari 3.0 will be included. While some seem to be not impressed by Leopard, it is by all accounts an OS upgrade, with every major application recieving attention. To me I am overjoyed the finder is getting a revamp, though I am not certain following iTunes layout is such a good idea. I think this is Steve Jobs (CEO. Apple Inc) idea to “switch” windows people since they already use iTunes, although I am not sure it is the right path. I choose Mac OS X because its unique, it has a fresh take on how a user interacts with a computer, moreso than Linux (which adopts tried and true in the case of Gnome and KDE), and certainly Windows which has only tweaked the look since Windows 95: its the same concept. The fanning out of dock icons, and grouping them won’t be used by the vast majority of users: its the same reason they don’t use “smart” folders: its a feature that has little in the way of wide appeal. I know the same can be said of the dashboard, and I personally will most likely end up buying and using fanning out and collections in Leopard, but my experience of novices is that they are afraid of the unknown.\nPerhaps why I wrote this is that I don’t understand what people really expected from Apple. Comments such as “everything in Leopard has been done before”, well I think this statement is true of every consumer Operating System: things (generally) don’t get tried out on novice users. So back to my question: is it worth the wait? Look at the above list and decide for yourself. I feel Tiger is good enough (then again Technology never stays still, Bill Gates “128K RAM is good enough for anyone should tell us that), and I predict Leopard will face adoption like Windows does: Tech buffs will buy the boxed retail version (I include myself in this), while everybody else will get it through a new computer purchase.\n","description":"","tags":["apple","mac"],"title":"Leopard - Worth the wait?","uri":"/leopard-worth-wait/"},{"content":"I just bought a HP Photosmart R927, an 8 Megapixel camera from Hewlett-Packard. While I had seen and briefly used one before, I was excited again upon using my own one (as all tech people are [read: geeks]). First of all don’t confuse me as anyway into photography: I’m not and far from it. I had a criteria in mind when I purchased and this was it:\nMust work under any OS (Windows [a given], Mac and Linux [latter two I only use]) Every camera I have come across mounts as a disc drive [think looking at files on a cd or your local computer], but there is also PTP or “Picture Transfer Protocol” in other words it doesn’t appear as picture files, rather PTP triggers your computer to open your camera in your photo application. I was unsure if this PTP would work under Mac or Linux, since I had only briefly seen it as an option in digiKam. It turns out on Mac there is Image Capture, and Ubuntu (My Linux distribution of choice) it automatically detects it and asks to import photos intoF-Spot.\nIt must have decent Image Quality Now decent to me means decent as in “a 128kbps MP3 sounds the same as a cd”! I am not talking uber-quality, far from it. There is already a Samsung 6MP camera in my household, and it more than does the job, despite occasionally messing up focus and being nearly two years old. I want a “point and click” with decent image quality, and I believe we are mostly there with todays cameras (compared to old 35mm film. I know only SLR come under the term “decent image quality” to some [professionals].\nIt must have portability Phone cameras are an indication of the future, there won’t be any real cameras besides ones used by professionals eventually. Why? Portability. People don’t want 20 devices and the weight attached to it, I have trouble making sure wallet, keys and my phone are on me, and a camera adds to this striuggle today.This is the same reason people are ditching cd’s for iPods: portability.\nNow for my review: The R927 looks good, but with camera sizes decreasing, it ends up being bigger than most. Its brushed metal feel is somewhat amusing, maybe a tribute to Apple Computers Brushed Metal theme in iTunes? The picture quality is great, and it certainly matches and beats many other cameras I have tried. My R927 came with a dock, and the camera itself has only one port: a usb one [This as I am after finding out is not true, the one port on the camera is non-standard usb it seems, so it can only be used through a dock, rather annoying if your travelling it seems to me!]. I really liked that fact as it clears up clutter and removes confusion, with only one slot, for one cable (I am thinking of many other similar sized cameras than try to have the kitchen sink with a port for video, a second memory card port, usb port, basically: every port possible).\nIts screen is something to behold: bright, clean, clear and crisp. This apparently comes at a cost though, in a PC World review ( in which this camera ranked #2 out of #10 “Point and Click Cameras”), they said it had the shortest life at 114 photos of any in the top 10. Since I only have mine a few hours, I can’t comment on this yet, but one thing I will say: the battery is easily replaceable: I found the exact same 3.7 V Li-ion battery in my Bluetooth GPS Receiver (a low end one), so buying a backup battery they said might be a good option.\nThe Cameras photo manipulation is full featured, as are the menus in this camera. You can crop, change contrast, brightness, add frames and dozens of other features without touching photo editing software on a computer. Is that a plus or minus? Depends on the user really, I might use it the odd time, but as someone who likes long lasting batteries: it won’t be too often I will. It modes are variful and plenty also: beach mode, auto mode, landscape, portrait, theatre, panaroma etc. Panorama is a lot of fun, but it takes a while for the camera to “stitch” the photos, and if made out of high quality images: beware, the panorma won’t be as of the same quality. Document Mode puzzled me, the camera says it captures text clearly. This wasn’t the case in my experience and with no text recognition software in the camera or accompanying software, one could be left typing a long document from looking at an image of one!!\nIt’s design and layout are elegant and useful. The main navigation d-pad feels a bit clicky (with a clicky sound to match) and the zoom is controlled by the far-edges of an upside-down “L” shape. It has a: Flash Button, Contrast Button, Sharing Button. Preview button and On/Off. The sharing button is linked to HP’s software and allows you to select photos to email, print and share upon your connection to a computer. I found this annoying as I do things manually, but some average users might consider this a bonus. I got a dock, a power cable, usb cable, and UK \u0026 Ireland plus a European plug within the camera’s very nice package.\nOverall I’d give it an 8.8/10 so far. Battery life leads me to lower its score somewhat, and the fact that the camera is bulkier than most. Other than that it is a great buy, and well recommended thus far. I will update this if I ever have any problems with it!\n","description":"","tags":["hardware","review"],"title":"HP Photosmart R927 Review","uri":"/hp-photosmart-r927/"},{"content":"Hard to believe really, Mr.Gates lists Windows Vista ‘innovations’.

They are testing the market at the moment which explains why they are shipping stock drivers with the hardware, and no multimedia codecs (which is unfortunate, but understandable that this deal was done in 60 days). I think this is quite an achievement for Canonical and Mark Shuttleworth (Ubuntu Founder), as they get to do the traditional Linux business model: you pay for support, and if you don’t need it, you don’t buy it. This could confuse some people in the shorter term, but long term its a winner: Dell does what it does best (Hardware) and Software is left to Ubuntu’s parent company Canonical. This is opposed to Microsoft getting Dell to provide support for both hardware and software, sometimes a messy business in which the consumer does not know which to turn to and can often be left out in the cold. I hope Dell extends this to Europe and 6the rest of the world soon, and makes a decent stab at promoting a free software desktop.

Keratoconus (from Greek: kerato- horn, cornea; and konos cone), is a degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye in which structural changes within the cornea cause it to thin and change to a more conical shape than its normal gradual curve. In plain English, light bends in a distorted way to make vision ghosted, blurry and less sharp. Glasses cannot fix this problem as they fix issues with your natural lense behind the cornea, as usually it has improper focus.\nThankfully it is a rare disorder, perhaps genetic and it only occurs in 1 out of every 1,000 people or so, I am wearing hard gas permeable (Oxygen can go through them) lenses which are the biggest pain in the world to wear, hard pieces of plastic literally sitting on your eye. This is a short term solution however, as my eyes will continue to degenerate for the next 20 years or so, then will be most likely followed by a Cornea transplant (ie. I recieve some other [usually dead!] persons’ corneas). There is technology being worked on, such as slicing the cornea and inserting half a contact lense (literally) in each side to prop it up. Most likely I am more fortunate then a person diagnosed with it 10 or 20 years ago, as time is on my side. The reason I don’t talk about it as I don’t want it to be a sop story or people to have pity, it is just a fact of my life, one which I am optimistic of for the future. Maybe awareness can help raise money for reasearch and such forth, that would make make me happy.

My aims are as follows:\nHas to be free, either price and/or freedoms. Huge emphasis placed on Open Source Licenses that conform to the OSI’s free software (and Debian) guidelines. Preference on cross platform multiplayer games. Each version should contain mostly the same games, with a few exceptions, based on quality. There will be three versions, Win, Mac \u0026 Linux (Each a DVD-R full) Must have brain-dead easy installers (Mostly a non-issue) We won’t host any software, just do documentation and folder structure. We then provide a site where people can cherry pick what they want their UGD to contain. So that pretty much sums this project up. It will be organised on Launchpad.

These same people never admit the things Europe does right, which may well be this hopefully landslide affect against destroying DRM. To quote The Register:\nIn the space of 24 hours Apple has gone from announcing an all-singing, all-dancing DRM-free deal with EMI, to facing the possibility of being slapped by EU fines of up to 10 per cent of the firm’s worldwide annual turnover.\nAnd it is not alone - the major record labels, including EMI, could also be hit by the same fines.\nAs we reported earlier, the European Commission has issued a Statement of Objections “against alleged territorial restrictions in online music sales to major record companies and Apple”.\nWhile although the EU certainly wasn’t the main motivation, I think that was profit, but nonetheless it should be given credit for the stick and carrot treatment of Apple and the record labels. I count the consumer organisations of Germany, France and the toughest one to Apple: Norway, as part of the Europe wide effort.

My Top 10 Apps of 2007 in descending order:\n10. Spybot Search and Destroy\nAlways a must on spyware infested Windows XP installs I come across (Unfortunately all to often). It removes a lot of the bad stuff, and my most used feature is system startup section, as I can stop all that crud from loading and slowing everything to a crawl. 9. iTunes (OS X Version)\nApple’s Music player definitely has a nice feel to it, shame about the copy protection from the iTunes Store. That doesn’t really impinge on my use of it however, I use it to manage my iPods , Podcasts etc. and occasionally l listen to Internet Radio. 8. The Gimp - Ugly as sin, but useful as anything you’ll ever find for free. The Gimp is the image editor of choice when I do my (admittedly very light) photo editing. It also cross platform, on Linux, Mac and Windows. While there are alot of other good free image editors, for all round utility I find the Gimp has it sewn up.\n**7. **** ***Google Earth *- Okay Google Earth is pointless for most things, but it is nice to watch a tour of famous landmarks you have never seen (Eiffel Tower anyone?). While its utility is perhaps limited, it still provides good fun and a break from productivity.\n**6. ***Spotlight, Beagle \u0026 Google Desktop *- Whatgood is any system if you can’t find anything? I have to admit I am a neat freak when it comes to files on a computer, I have them properly hierarchically sorted, I only wish I was as organized in real life. But for those occasional files I misplace, these three utilitys are invaluable. Spotlight on Mac OS X launches most of my prigrams, Beagle on Linux is super fast and unobtrusive and on Windows it doesn’t get better than Google Desktop with all those handy widgets for information blurbs.\n5. OpenOffice / KOffice / NeoOffice- All the suites are free, and they come with great legacy document handling. I don’t use office applications a whole lot for personal use, but these two I would would pay cold hard cash for, because there that good. I use Koffice on Linux where possible, due to its improved speed (as I use KDE Desktop). Koffice will be going multiplatform by the end of this year, and OpenOffice is working on a native Mac OS X port (a void which NeoOffice already fills), all in all a good time for free office suites.** **\n4. ** Google Talk \u0026 Adium - When on Windows, its got to be Google Talk, even better now that they have a gadget (it’s on my contact page). When I am on my Mac laptop, its got to be Adium. Adium is the first Open Source application on this list, and for good reason, it has made beautiful use of GAIM libraries to craft a stunning messenger application. Linux messengers miss out for a variety of reasons, but Psi came close to the two above. **\n**3. **iPhoto - An OS X only app, it is a beautiful centre-piece to the invaluable iLife suite from Apple. iPhoto lets me export whole albums as movies (which I then upload to YouTube), original sized pictures and more. It makes my life easier so much so, I have stopped photos being put on any other machine in my home network, they go straight to iPhoto, waiting to get to a critical mass to be wiped and copied to a DVD and my protable hard drivr, which iPhoto does in a few clicks. It does it with style als0, something which Apple is now much lauded for. Although it doesn’t come close to what photography pro’s want, it makes my life that much easier, plus I get all those nice embarrassing ones (of other people) on my iPod ready to be shown on the move! iMovie missed out as we don’t really video anything important in my household.\n2. Mozilla Firefox - While it still has quirks as all browsers do, nothing makes me feel as good about the web as Firefox does. Its myriad of extensions and huge community which keep it secure is just somethings worth mentioning about this wonderful browser.\n1. Amarok - Without a doubt the best music manager on the planet. I am amazed at its handling of Digital Music Players, including iPods. It is lighting fast with a proper database behind it, so even if you have a large music collection as I do, it will not go slow or die on you. Its built in music store serves fresh mp3’s, and its onscreen display of songs lets you know what tunes you’re listening to. It has a million and one scripts to make it do anything, an alarm clock perhaps? done. Tell your friends what your listening to on your contact list? done. A web interface so you can use a remote or laptop to control it? done. All of these are a few clicks away, even for new users it’s a breath of fresh air. Visualizers, faders, any music type you can dream of is playable, I could go on all night, Amarok has it all and more. Like Koffice it is only really on Linux (well, Unix-based) at this point, but its development team are promising OS X and Windows versions. My bet is it’ll fly faster off the shelves than Mozilla Firefox has…\nI plan to follow this up and make a series, I have a lot to say!

You may have seen on sites something to the effect of “Welcome Google user!”, that website knows exactly what you typed to get to it. Tor routes your online activity through different computers, for example mine went through an educational institution in the US and an Internet Service Provider in the Netherlands.\nBut if you want privacy you have something to hide! Not true. You don’t hand over records of everywhere you go in reality, nor documents, or details of medical conditions etc., their is a genuine use case for privacy in the modern world which is sadly being eroded.

I got rather confused when a Franz Ferdinand album appeared on the list, when their debut album did not. Seems the record label did a deal with Sony for distribution. I found a piece of information quite old now (May 2006), but interesting anyway:\n“Opponents also challenge the idea that back catalogue revenues provide investment for new ventures and to support new artists. Peter Jameson of the BPI (British Phonographic Industry) argued in The Guardian on 24 April that such investment had contributed to a boom in new British music, citing artists such as Arctic Monkeys, James Blunt and Kaiser Chiefs. However, Arctic Monkeys are with Domino Records, which was founded in 1993 and rarely re-releases records that predate itself, and James Blunt was signed by the US label Custard Records, which was set up only in 2004 and so has little back catalogue material to release; the same is true of Kaiser Chiefs, who are signed to B-Unique, which was also founded in 2004. Those are hardly good examples of recording companies that rely on significant revenue from the back catalogue profits that would be under threat if we were to stick at the 50-year copyright term.” ( Via Digital Rights Network and associated other sources)\nI find the whole Digital Rights Management thing very interesting, will the greedy dinosaurs of the recording industry win?

The last design was my own, but I had awful trouble implementing to look the same in all browsers (especially Internet Explorer, even the latest one, argh). I know the old one can be improved, so I am submitting to WP Themes directory, which I will update this post with the link. I love the new theme, it brings what I couldn’t to the old one: choosable colours and sameness across browsers. I’d like to thank Justin Winslow for that!

So now you know these are the official DF’s colours!\nFurther to this, I appreiciate the way posts (on their own page) now take up the whole page. I don’t know about all of you, but I hate intrusive sidebars. Sidebars in general are a necessary evil (for navigating the site!), but I am also happy this design is more “ergonomic”.

What do I think? Well I have put of writing this for 4 days, as I wanted to really test it out. Before I start, I should say I was part of the Nokia Developer Device program, and I got the Nokia N800 at a big discount, €300 off the €399 retail price in fact. Under headings below I will take about the N800, and compare it to the 770:\nBattery Life:\nThis sees an improvement in the N800 alright, as it is meant for standby. The N770 hadn’t got great battery life really at all, so it seems Nokia payed more attention to the fact it is a communications device, and like phones it needs the juice for use! I guess part of this is that they cut out lots of unesscessary stuff from the Linux kernels boot up, as the device also boots way faster, and has more of a touch a button and your in business type-of-feel.\nErgonomics \u0026 Design:\nThis is a dissapointment on the N800. It looks nice, all the buttons on the front are okay, but the ones on top are disastrous. I bet a marketing person, or a designer who knows nothing (but should) about ergonomics got a hold of it. It feels like buttons on a phone at the top of the N800, hunched together as they have no room. I wouldn’t complain if I didn’t use these so often, but they are used by almost every program you want to use on the N800! The N770 had much better idea, spaced out the Zoom (+ \u0026 -), fullscreen (on/off) and the power button.\nBluetooth:\nStill relatively the same as the N770, yet Nokia have modified software so that it will accept Bluetooth keyboards, headsets(? Haven’t tried) and other devices officially through the control panel on the device. This marks a push by Nokia to sell all of these when you are buying the N800, which is an improvement in my eyes.\nStorage:\nBig improvement here, the N800 not only accepts paltry RS-MMC cards, but SD amongst others. Not only that but the device has two memory card slots, each capable of 2GB cards. The N770 recieved critiscism for using a format not widely in distribution (RS-MMC), so they listened to what the feedback was. Now its a snap for me to swap in my camera’s SD card and look at those photos on the move!\nMemory:\nAlso a huge improvement. The N800 comes with 128mb RAM, and it shows. Since I have had the device, I had as much as ten windows open (Browser, RSS Reader, Maemo Mapper, Media Streamer etc) and it ran like as smooth as any device I have ever used. I guess they are really optimising the software for the platform, which shows, like in the boot time above. The N770 had 64mb, a slower processor and you felt it. It did what it was supposed to, but under 4-5 windows it would screech to a halt, not good for a tablet. You had to resort to memory swapping applications (basically using the memory card as RAM).\nWeb Browsing \u0026 Messaging:\nWeb Browsing seems the same as the N770, it mighty be faster, but that could be due to RAM. A huge dissapointment is no Flash 9, which means no Youtube or other flash content. Did I mention this is a huge mistake? People who buy these devices expect their favourite websites to just work, so a big thumbs down on that front, but hopefully it will be fixed. Messaging is superb on the N800, and its touchscreen thumb keyboard is a joy to use. I feel I could type faster on it given enough time compared to a real keyboard, so this is definately good. I am a big fan of Google Talk and open standards jabber, so I love the voice calling part of it. It seems crisp, clear and almost as good as normal phone. I have tried a video call, and well it is not as good as I expected. The camera doesn’t seem good quality, but it serves ita purpose. I tried Nokia Video call feature, and well it was also not good. It dropped voice, video was grainy and the software not on the N800 was for PC only, not Linux or Mac. I guess this is because Nokia don’t own a messaging service, but I have one piece of advice: don’t bother. Better leave the messaging to people in the know, like Skype. Although Skype is against everything I believe in (open standards) its inclusion in the N800 gives better choice, and should be welcomed.\nPersonal Information Management:\nA big let down I am afraid. Being a Mac user, I expect seamless integration of contacts and syncing. Maybe Nokia’s PC suite works with the N800, I have’t tried. But that said, why doesn’t it sync with my Nokia 6234 phone? With GoogleTalk set to include SIP calling, and Skype has SkypeOut, I need an easy way to reach all my numbers, to avoid my mobile phone networks high prices! I don’t think they worked on PIM features since the 770, and it shows. This is fundamental to a communications device!\nOverall, the N800 is a nice device and a definate improvement on the 770, but I have a few software and device design issues. I understand their is limitations in price (what market will accept) and that maybe Nokia were on a deadline, release something after Christmas to boost sales which I imagine level off. That said the N800 is not a PDA, or a phone, so what is it? A tiny laptop? This one I think even confuses Nokia, but I like it. It makes the Internet Tablet range stand out, and they mean different things to different people. I give it 7.5/10 which can rise to a nine if Nokia fix some issues!\nRead another great review by Luis Villa on Planet Gnome.\n","description":"","tags":["review","hardware"],"title":"Nokia N800 Review","uri":"/nokia-n800/"},{"content":"Well as I write this it is a few days after Vista’s launch, and it has yet to set the software market alight.

There has been a lot more FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt)abput Vista already from the Free and Open Source camp. Some of the harsh critiscims will be justified, others probably not. Regardless this will not hurt Microsofts marketing whatsoever, the average user doesn’t share concerns over digital restriction/rights management - yet.

Picture this: no CD-Recordables to be burnt, no settings to set, 10 minute .exe click install just like any Windows application and you will see what I mean. Add to that no partitioning (Ubuntu uses a disk image in Windows), no modification of Windows file and an Add/Remove option to get rid of it, and instantaneously you see the appeal, I cannot wait for this project to be mature, and heres hoping Ubuntu use it for mass distribution.

On the Irish “Get the Facts” page (on Windows Server vs. Linux), they make critical errors of judgement a person reasonably well versed in computing could deconstruct. First of all, Linux isn’t a server, its a kernel, like the Windows kernel. So comparing “Windows Server 2003” to “Linux” is misleading to say the least, and stupid to say the most.

Most people have heard of Computer Aided Design, but usually the applications are expensive to say the least.

The video tutorials Google provides on their website is a huge help, and got me off to a good start. They represented what every tutorial should be: short, snappy and to the point.

Linspire is a commercial Linux distribution, so they include all of the proprietary codecs most others simply can´t for reasons of cost. Freespire is not up to Ubuntus standard (not as big pool of developers/community) and the stable version uses an out-dated KDE and a horrible menu. Despite this, it has its charm, like click and run, a better implementation of the APT packaging system (common to [Debian][s]-based distros) and is probably the easiest distro I have seen to install and run. It don´t have a partitioner, so it will overwrite Windows (Hey not always a bad thing ;-) ). But setup is easy, and I love the way it brings you to configure your own settings at one simple screen after an install. My family love it, and complement it left-right and center!

I do recognise, that the Internet was partially created with the help of U.S. government funding, but this comes from the people of America, who would want the Internet to be a force for change, like for example, the way it is helping Chinese dissidents.Also, as with all US government generated ideas, it is free from patent and copyright which applies worldwide, such as NASA images, for example. This should be true of the Internet also, as it is with GPS (which I use regularly, Thanks for that!).

That is that corruption can be a force for the good of the public, and my rich friends?\nAlso I would like to unreservedly apologize that this site has been down for so long. The thing is my ex-hosting provider, which I won’t even honor with a link, was an incompetent mess. I have now moved to an Irish company, Hosting365.ie, which gives me freephone support all for a little extra money. Also their premises is in Dublin, which means I can call in at any time and I get the protection of Irish Law (even though we know its a mess [e.g. Mr.A child abuser being set free], I still think we have an alright civil liberties protection, even though I know nothing about law, so I am most likely misguided, anyhoo!) of course not without paying the 21% VAT, which needs to be lowered might I add.\nThis isn’t my usual tech babble I know, but I’ll end this post with the news that I am BETA testing the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet Edition 2006 [maemo.org]. It rocks so hard, I can’t even begin to say… First of theirs GoogleTalk built in, with support for SIP (might be from Gizmo). Notwithstanding that, their are cool native applications such as MaemoPad Plus [Sketch/Notes] and MaemoMapper [GPS+ Google Maps]. Somehow they have squeezed more battery life out of this gadget, and now you can create a swap on the memory card, meaning its, I’d say (pure speculation, obviously) 80% more efficient. Warning to people who actually use the 770 for important stuff, don’t upgrade until Nokia has released it, as it is very buggy, with applications crashing [somewhat] alot. Wait until all of us in the know, report those pesky bugs! But a real geek can see through the flaws and see the Nokia 770 for what it is, a truly cool Internet tool.\n","description":"","tags":["video","politics"],"title":"Questions, Hosting and IT 2006!","uri":"/questions-hosting-and-it-2006/"},{"content":"I regularly read other Irish blogs to see whats happening and whats the latest tech thing amongst others.

I am exicted about this, as I hope to convince all my neighbours eventually to get it, and maybe who knows, I may even achieve the biggest fon hotspot, if I take my campaign estate wide, to neighbours all around! I want to “eat my own dog food” as they say, so I will wait until I have recieved and used my router before I recommend it to non-technical people. I have read of long delays on FON’s forums, so I expect iot should be here within two to three weeks, maybe a little longer.

It was voted one of the fifty best places to work last year. I am very exicited at the prospect, as I will gain many insights on the life of working. They own a number of franchise lotterys around the world, including the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain. I also, as part of my new job, join the Dublin commute. Iarnrod Eireann, while after coming on in recent years is a fine company, I still believe it has a long way to go. The lack of a cheap, clean and friendly transport system does hurt Dublin in terms of tourism and business, of that I have no doubt. I was recently in Rome, which you get 75 minutes unlimited travel on the bus, plus one metro journey, all for, get this, €1! Yes you read that correctly €1! Why can’t we do this? I think we can, but we need an integrated transport system first. How come after all these years you still cannot get a ticket for Bus, Train and Luas in one?

Ireland being an island economy, is especially reliant on oil, none of which we produce. I was surprised earlier this week to hear one of George W. Bush’s top aides, saying that the U.S. needs to lose dependence on foreign oil and research alternatives. I was never more shocked, to hear Bush’s change of heart, from using improved technology, to one of his aides saying they need to use less oil. Part of me was angry, as he defiantly rejected Kyoto agreement, when the United States produces 25+% of all greenhouse gases.\nSo we get to the question of Nuclear power, which has been controversial in Ireland, but not continental Europe for years. We all know about Chernobyl, and its harrowing effects on the world. But we also cannot cut off our hand to spite our face, should we ban footballs because they hurt people? or Cars because people get killed? The reality is, Cars have killed more people throughout history, than all nuclear incidents combined (50,000 every year in the U.S. alone). The reality is also this, within 100 miles of Dublin (Ireland’s Capital), there at least 10 nuclear plants, within 1,000 miles, this rises to over 100 nuclear plants. France generates over 70% of its power through Nuclear power, whilst the U.K. generates 25%. We cannot produce enough power in Ireland, so we buy power from the United Kingdom, being in direct benefit of that 25%.\nEverybody I have spoken to, around my age, have nearly all said the exact same thing, we will have to use nuclear power, whether we like it or not. If one of those plants were to suffer a meltdown, it is unavoidable that we will suffer, so why not benefit from Nuclear power while we can? People will bring up Chernobyl, but the fact is, plants like Chernobyl are old soviet technology, which is no longer used and was designed when we were naive about nuclar power. Also radiation effects are most damging to humans, whilst animals are starting to return to Chernobyl. The Ukraine is commissioning more and more nuclear plants, and it was one of the worst affected areas of the whole disaster. Nuclear Power : We cannot afford to live without it, even one of the founders of Greenpeace, one of the most militant enviromentalist groups, now accepts this. The Internet literally buzzes with Nuclear news and developments, compared to renewables.\n","description":"","tags":["politics"],"title":"Nuclear or Nothing?","uri":"/nuclear-or-nothing/"},{"content":"Even while podcasts are relatively new (well a couple of years - like blogs), Irish Radio Stations are surprisingly well in on the act.

The answers boils down to no, we can’t. If we make it illegal, the spamsters move abroad or go underground, as we have seen in the United States. People have been prosecuted, but again this does not deter people. Spamhaus have a novel idea, by trusting domains on reputation, based on spam reports. But this has one fatal flaw, it involves people reporting spam.\nThe situation is not as bad if you use Gmail, that is Google Mail. For over a year and a half,I got spam, but it was properly sorted and easily deletable. Before that I used Yahoo Mail, which like Hotmail before that, would mark items I wanted as spam, which is never acceptable. I am not saying Gmail is perfect, as I have recieved 3 spam messages into my inbox (thats 3 out of well over 3000 emails, so a tiny percentage, .3). What can we do to deter people from spamming us? I believe awarness is the key. Google, Yahoo and all major web companies should advertise a charity set up to inform people on spam, phising and the like. Have a nice flash guide on how to spot fraudulent behaviour! Why should these companies do this? Because it will save them money, if spammers get the message!\n","description":"","tags":["email"],"title":"Spam, will it ever stop?","uri":"/spam-will-it-ever-stop/"},{"content":"Google have released a calendar, as part of their mission to “Organise the Worlds Information”.

It does integrate with Gmail, although the full extent has yet to be seen, as they fall short of mentioning it in Gmail at all, but I would expect this to change. I see great potential for users though, and where Google is heading. They will eventually integrate it with GoogleTalk and Gmail, producing a hybrid interface where you can organise a conference on GoogleTalk, schedule it on your calendar (which is syncronised with your PC and your workgroup server [therby informing fellow employees]), submit video of it to Google Video, write minutes with writely, email minutes with Gmail, that mail (with document and video) being attached to the meeting on the Calendar, which is in turn archived on your PC in Google Desktop and your Gmail Drive. While that is only one scenario, it is very possible. Google have already leaked information on their eagerness to hold the entire contents of ones’ hard drive on the internet.\nThis of course leads to privacy fears, will the U.S. or Chinese governments have access to literally anything on your computer? The Electronic Frontier Foundation is an online rights advocacy group, and they recently discouraged people from downloading the latest Google Desktop, due to the fact it will backup your information online for 30 days. You can exclude folders and files from Google Desktops index, but this is a manual process. So where will the future lie, and how far will Google go to get the most relevent results?

Not least is lack of intergration between them. Take SIP used by VOIP providers, such as OpenWengo. While OpenWengo is open source, and it is SIP, they are not helpful in informing you how to use other clients, or dial other OpenWengo users from other networks.\nWhat I am really talking about is the need for an all-in-one communications program, that is multi-platform. Their is already open source code for: Google Talk (aka Jabber), MSN, AOL, ICQ, SIP, H.323, Yahoo! but why isn’t their an all-in-one client? Surely it would be easy to reimplement some code from other programs into Ekiga (SIP, H.323) , Kopete or Gaim (both Jabber, MSN, Yahoo, AOL and ICQ)? I know GoogleTalk is based on SIP, so why not SIP compatability? That is poor implementation which is fragmenting the Open Source community, how are we going to challenge MSN’s userbase with this sort of fragmentation? That said I like Google Talk and its way of doing things. Also it is rumoured GoogleTalk will be interoperable with AOL at protocol level, since Google owns 5% of AOL.\nThis is also a factor across open standards, such as Ogg Vorbis, the open alternative to MP3. Rather than people developing a kernel to run Matrix backgrounds on an iPod, why not develop an Ogg Vorbis decoder? That way nearly 80% of the digital music player market could possibly play Ogg Vorbis, rather than the current selection of a few iRivers, less than 1%. If Open Source is serious about the desktop and its formats, we have to work together and stop forking our efforts!

What is a domain? A domain is the name used for internet site like “dueyfinster.eu”. It has already sold over 1.25 million names already, this entering the third day of the public sale. Their have been bitter critics of how it has dealt out, with heated arguments over some domains such as Polo.eu, which was claimed by no less than 3 entities: Volkswagen, Ralph Lauren and Nestle. Volkswagen won out eventually, all because they got their application in first.\nWhy is it important? Well I think it is, not only because I own one, but because it creates a Europe wide identity, suitable for individuals and companies. I think personally, it wasn’t handled the best way possible, with all major companies not having control of their domains by Landrush period (Landrush is the public sale). It will be months for PriceWaterhouseCoopers in Belgium to sift through all documents companies have submitted. Surpisingly, United Kingdom has registered the most domain names and is one of the most Eurosceptic countries, while France have only slightly registered more than other smaller countries such as Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands.\nTheir is also speculation that Swiss and Norweigan companies may miss out, as they are not part of the European Union (EU). Maybe this explains why Nestle weren’t so lucky registering Polo.eu? I don’t know, but I hope this domain brings new meaning to European citizenship, and makes us all proud to be part of the largest trading block in the world.\n","description":"","tags":["politics","europe"],"title":"Europe's New Voice","uri":"/europes-new-voice/"},{"content":"\nDo you say Baybo or Beebo?

One blogger reported 70m was made by the corporation, with a Mozilla insider confirming thats a reasonable ballpark figure. Christopher Blizzard, board member of Mozilla, had this to say on his blog:\nBlizzard added that an earnings figure of $72m (£41m) quoted on some blogs was incorrect. “I won’t comment on the dollar amount except to say that it’s [$72m] not correct, though not off by an order of magnitude. I also won’t comment on sources of that money, except to say that some of the assertions that I’ve seen in the comments are pretty far off, both in terms of numbers and sources,\nOne obvious source of the money is Google Inc., which Firefox gives prominance to as the default search engine, of the open source browser. Jason Calacanis, the chief executive of blogging network Weblogs, wrote in his blog that an unnamed source at BarCampLA told him:\nCalacanis claimed that when a Firefox user does a Google search using the browser’s search box, Mozilla receives approximately 80 percent of the ad revenue from any associated ad clicks.\nPretty impressive for a company, which only earned 5m in 2004. The continued success in Firefox is shown in the the 10-fold increase of Mozilla’s profits. Most People wish Mozilla well, with some questioning the Corporations commitment to better development, in favour of more lucrative contracts, this, of course, is denied by everyone at Mozilla Corp.

Ubuntu has cleaned a lot of dependency hell up, and a new program for installing software from the internet, is included in the new version, due to be released 1st June 2006.\nThat’s when I discovered a little gem called Klik for many Linux distributions. Simply lookup the piece of software you need, click on it and you have it! No need to install! It places the whole program on the desktop, so it is easily deletable and easily transferable. For example, if you have an office application, and your friend doesn’t, simply copy that file on desktop to your usb key or a cd, and copy to friends pc, done and dusted - Your friend has the whole application! This is an obvious feature bonus over current Windows version, XP.\nTheir is some teething problems, some applications fail to work, and in Ubuntu it has a dependency of libstdc++, a library of files to make it work. Easy instructions to install Klik are included on their website, though. It seems they are seeking co-operation from Ubuntu aneedsd other distributions to iron out problems, which is always a good sign. Klik also trys to have “bleeding edge” stable versions of software, so in distrobutions not upgraded frequently, this can cause more problems. Out of ten, I’d give Klik an 8.5, as it still needs ironing-out. But then again I have been using the web for over ten years, so novice users may feel different on its ease of use.\n","description":"","tags":["software","linux","review"],"title":"Just Klik it!","uri":"/just-klik-it/"},{"content":"So you have heard of Ubuntu, maybe they have even shipped you a free disc or you have downloaded one? Like most users, even advanced PC users, they get nervous about installing Linux and afraid of what they might have to learn. Touted as the brighest star, Ubuntu really does outshine other Linuxes, with usability, features and great range of software. Now you can try Ubuntu on Windows.\nHow can I try it, is what I always get asked, without risk to my computer? First of all, you need to download Ubuntu Virtual. This in laymans terms, is Ubuntu compressed into one file. Think of that file as the “Tape”, now you need the “Tape Player”, along comes VMWare Player. Simply install VMware Player, and then find the “Ubuntu Tape” file, in VMware Player. Thats it! No installation required of Ubuntu.\nSimilarly, you can use VMware player to emulate Windows on Ubuntu.

I see the merits of the two, as they are different. Most people don’t see this distinction, that although the two OSes do many of the same functions, they remain lightyears apart. I have to admit I preach Linux to the hilt, I shouldn’t, but I do. I get skeptical Windows users who ask me what Linux does better, and I am stuck for an answer, as it does a lot of tasks better.\nFor example, half life of Windows vs. Ubuntu (My Distro of Choice), Ubuntu wins hands down. Its the way that its very hard to install stuff to decrease system speed, yet on Windows it is terrifingly easy. I am on my cousins computer at the moment, sure enough its at the year stage and takes ages to load anything. Its got the usual bloatware, such as a very bulky antivirus/firewall, they own an iPod which starts iTunes and Quicktime, Use MSN \u0026 Skype and other stuff that start automatically, which is why Windows is crippled, they all have the computers resources for breakfast! I get one of two answers, either A) Sure I use all of them, thats convienience! or B) Sure you can switch it off in the programs preferences. My answer to A) No it isn’t, you try run a game, or office suite, you soon find you won’t be able to listen to that song in the background on iTunes, or watch that movie on Quicktime, or message those friends of yours on MSN, you soon find you can’t do any of them, and to B) Most users don’t want the hassle to turn it off, why can’t their computer “Just Work”, like Windows users are fond of pointing out?\nMy issue with Microsoft, is that, in the course to make software accessible, they left security and their morals at the door. In Linux, we have a permissions system, you don’t have permission to modify a file, though. On Windows every user gets equal access, but this means so does every Virus and piece of spyware. What good is the Banking document if the whole world knows its contents? What Linux does best is it focuses on Software, and quality is the bottom line. If a feature isn’t ready, it will not be released to the public, full stop.\nStill I get Windows people that refuse to budge, even though concerns are well documented. I havesome things to say to them, it doesn’t matter what you think, let me illustrate this to be clear: Their are 900 Million pc’s in the world, of which 90% use Windows. In India and China, lie 1/3 of this earths population ( 2 Billion ), most popular OS? Linux. Give it twenty years, when wealth increases, this will be reflected when Windows share dwindles. Case in Point: South America: the Brazilian Govt. has switched totally to Linux, now the countries most popular OS, this trend is continuing across South America, buoyed by Anti-Americanism. Also Africa, the worlds poorest continent is set to see huge influxes of Linux wind up laptops. This continues to the developed world albeit at a much slower pace, with most European countries registering a decent linux percentage and even the European commision talking about Europe wide Open Source intiatives.\nWho Will Win? The average computer user, as software gets cheaper, choices and competition become more apparent.Even if your a loyal Windows user, I argue you try and encourage Linux developement, as in the end it will force Microsoft to be more competitive and make better software. Computing is not a luxury any more, it is an essential way of life, and its due to change more lives this century than ever before.\n","description":"","tags":["linux","windows"],"title":"Linux VS.

No one should be allowed to immigrate to the western world, if they do not hold the core values which we hold, such as human rights, free of expression/press and other values. Should we worry about the middle east? Not at all, they’re behind the times, their loss. Why is it that movies which parody Christianity are so popular with Christians (like Monty Python)?

This man is Alex Tew, hailed as an advertising genius by the many companies who are using his site to make Internet history.\nAlex believes he can make his goal by the end of 31st December 2005. In fact as of writing this, he has already made USD 936,700. The student says advertisers get to keep their ads for a period of five years from purchase and he says he will use the money he has made to guarantee it. Alex has said he has already got numerous job offers from companies aiming to secure his money making talent.Alex is doing business management course at Nottingham and needed GBP7000 a year to complete his studies. He is understandably overwhelmed by the success he has achieved:\nIt is just nuts. I am in a state of disbelief. It’s like Monopoly money but then I look at my bank account and there is a lot of cash in it. The method is simple, his website is made up of one page divided into 10,000 boxes, each 100 pixels in size. Companies can buy one or more boxes for USD $100 each and cover it with a logo, which, when clicked on, transports web users to the customers own site.\nThe figures add up with the site now carrying over 240 advertisements and has 30,000 hits a day. Even the actor Jack Black, star of School of Rock and Shallow Hal, is using the site to advertise his band Tenacious D. The British National Union of Students say 90% of students are in debt.\nBut the only money worries Alex now has is what to spend it all on. He has already splashed out on a black mini for himself, as he thinks of what to do with his new found fortune.\n","description":"","tags":["business"],"title":"Million Dollars, Nice!","uri":"/million-dollars-nice/"},{"content":"In case you have never looked at it, Click Online is the flagship technology program for the BBC. It broadcasts on the Internet and can be viewed even on a 56k modem. I have been watching click online for over a year and a half now, I first saw it on BBC World, while holidaying in Portugal. It also broadcasts on BBC News 24 at 7am on a Sunday morning (I have never seen it at this time!). Although by its nature a technical program, it is very much aimed at the average PC user and so most things are explained fully.\n","description":"","tags":["podcast","video"],"title":"Click Online","uri":"/click-online/"},{"content":"What a fantastic service Google now offer with their Google Video platform. There are a couple of reasons why I like it, mainly because it is available to upload your videos on all platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) and is available on Mozilla-based browsers (Firefox, Netscape), Opera and Internet Explorer.This is important in creating a better all round user experience. If only Yahoo! would follow Googles example and open up Launch Cast to other browsers besides an outdated version of Netscape and Internet Explorer.\nI have a criticism of Google Video also, and that is it takes too long to approve videos (8 days in my case), the should at least give an expected time- frame and allow notification through email when your video is accepted and available live on Google. Other than that the service is pretty good and as it is still in the Beta testing phase, Google have promised to make it better. This could be a precursor to Google trying to launch its own media-for-sale in the form of Music videos, who knows? One things for sure, it is going to steal the thunder from launchcast.\nMy first video I have uploaded is below, it is called “We Hate Coogie Bear : The Motion Picture”:\n","description":"","tags":["google","video"],"title":"Google Video","uri":"/google-video/"},{"content":"I got it! UPS delivered the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet. What can I say? It is pure magic! The features are great, it includes:\nWeb Browser (Opera) Flash Player version 6 Email Client Internet Radio News Reader Media players, Image viewer PDF viewer File Manager Search Calculator World Clock Notes Sketch Games It runs on Linux, making it totally extendable. It even has its own developer site at maemo.org, where applications can be downloaded. Hot on my list were Doom (the Game) and GAIM (Instant Messenger, uses Google Talk, AOL, MSN, Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, etc). Unfortunately their is no Skype for Nokia 770 just yet, but hopefully it will be here soon. Nokia has promised an upgrade in 2006, that will include VOIP, such as skype.\nAll major formats have good support on the Nokia 770, including:\nAudio: MP3, MPEG4-AAC, WAV, AMR, MP2, [OGG - (With download from Maemo)] Image: JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, PNG, Animated GIF format, SVG-tiny, ICO Video: MPEG1, MPEG4, Real Video, H.263, AVI, 3GP As soon as I took it out of the package, within minutes I was surfing, the only delay was trying to find MAC address (as my router uses access control list) which I eventually found underneath the battery. I thought this was a bit odd as Mac Address’ are easily attainable when it is connected to a network, so hopefully Nokia will revise this! The media card is also only 64mb, which gives a total free of about 108mb space. RS-MMC (The media card it uses) only come in prohibitive sizes and are expensive, this will most likely change if it is widely used. The stand that comes with it is the most difficult part of the package! It took me 20mins to try and figure out how to use the stand. All in all it is not a great stand, just two lumps of plastic. The battery seems respectable at the moment, with a predicted time of three hours battery life and seven days standby. I got a bit more then three hours when I first opened it, it worked out just a little over 3hrs 20mins. Not bad for a 2/3 full battery Nokia packs with new devices!\nNot surprisingly, reviews are excellent for it. A lot of noise is made of the fact that it is so customisable and that all of the programs for it are free! Abiword is also a must have, it opens and edits documents. It compared to other tablets is quite cheap, at about €369 including delivery, in Ireland.\nI will be posting updates on my free Wifi testing campaign soon, its all about to kick off! I will let you know best free wifi spots in and around Dublin area!\nAnywhere you think I should go? Please tell me, it will be useful!\n","description":"","tags":["hardware","review"],"title":"Nokia 770 Internet Tablet","uri":"/internet-tablet/"},{"content":"The British Press annoys me so much, they way they constantly get it wrong across the board about the EU. I am a fond supporter of the EU for all its faults and cracks. But I love freedom of the press and like organisations who uphold basic journalistic standards, such as the BBC. This leads me onto the evil man behind it all, Rupert Murdoch owner of The Sun, BSkyB Television, The Times and other media outlets. It seems all he pushes is his agenda, whether it be the Bush Right-Christian agenda on Fox in the US or Eurosceptic view in his British interests.\nI speak of this because of the shocking facts I discovered on an EU website, by the commissioner for the EU in The UK. Honestly some of the things that are published are unbelievable! One can only guess Murdoch motives (maybe to foster the special relationship between UK and USA even further?) Who knows? One thing is for certain, the US resent the EU bargaining power and good relations with China and Russia. One to hit the headlines was US supposedly using spy planes to ferry people to be tortured in countries such as Egypt (Known for bad Human Rights record).\nI think British People do not realise how beneficial giving money to aid development is, take my own country , Ireland for instance. Forty years ago we were a backward nation with no prospects, Now we are one of the richest in Europe and will become a contributor to the EU soon. We should aim to replicate the Ireland Effect in the new accession countries to help the develop. If they grow, it means an enlarged market for British made products, thereby helping generate more wealth - what goes around comes around, this is not a battle for identity with France or Germany any more!\n","description":"","tags":["politics","europe"],"title":"Eurosceptics","uri":"/eurosceptics/"},{"content":"While using instant messenger I had a brainwave, what will the tech landscape look like in the future? So here is What I think could happen: IBM will buy Sun MicroSystems and make a new opensource OS, it will be based on Ubuntu. Microsoft will purchase AOL and roll out its products on the Web, such as MS Office, it will have a slow start to Vista, but it will pick up through peoples eagerness to buy the latest hardware. Google will buy Opera, invest in Mozilla and consolidate Opera into Mozilla, it will also buy Adobe (for their PDF format), get its way to publish an online bookstore through Google Book Search. Yahoo will continue to buy extra companies to add to its list of a zillion services, such as Flickr and Del.icio.us.\nWhat do you think?

I hope to do a guide to restricted formats on Ubuntu soon, especially W32 Codecs and how to get all the good formats it offers (Divx, MPEG1-4, Windows Media, Quicktime Media and RealMedia)\nWe should all be using free formats, but everyone uses proprietary formats.

As I mentioned before, I hope to receive a Nokia 770 Internet Tablet soon, so I will be checking the free wireless services offered by Eircom in Dublin and at McDonalds restaurants.\nYou may have noticed the new look and this revamped blog. You may also question where has Duey Finsters Web Services gone? It is still here, but me and Thomas Whelan, who run it, cannot decide on a name. Maybe you all could help us out? Since well over 97% of all the words in the dictionary are registered as dot coms, we have no clue what to call ourselves.\nWe are looking for a unique name, that could be trademarked, so anything you suggest, you give us permission to use royalty-free (We might throw you a million, when we make ours). Once we get a name, the dot com will be registered and a totally new site will be designed.\nAlso new is a guides section, which will be part of the blog. The idea is I can write guides so other people can see how easy it is to actually do stuff. I plan to write a guide (Including pictures) for Linux and Windows using encrypted mail. On Linux, I will show both command and KGPG (the KDE graphical key maker) and on windows I will use WinPT (Windows Privacy Tools).\nThe Music and Bookmarks section are going to take a while for me to implement properly, as I am still practicing using PHP to render XML, but it should be fun. They both use feeds, Last.fm for music and del.icio.us for bookmarks. That reminds me, I just saw del.icio.us was bought by Yahoo!, I hope they do not ruin it like they did to Flickr and stick their name and advertising in every conceivable space on the page.\n","description":"","tags":["security"],"title":"Wireless, New Design and Web Services","uri":"/wireless-new-design-and-web-services/"},{"content":"Awake Mornin at nearly six am I am writing this at six am in my cousins home because I heard this is a good way to get a gmail invite!\n","description":"","tags":["google"],"title":"Duey Finster","uri":"/dueyfinster/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"","uri":"/archives/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"","uri":"/search/"},{"content":"Software Engineering Manager at Ericsson in Athlone, Ireland, managing teams in Software Development Kits (SDKs) for Encsson Intelligent Automation Platform (EIAP).
