<h1 class="post-title">iOS Shells, Prompt vs. Mosh</h1>
    
    <time>November 15, 2016</time>
    

    <div>
        
        <p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the shell and the productivity it brings, you can have a text
editor, command to run a server and more within easy reach. I use a shell at
work, at home and on the go. On the go could be using my iPad or iPhone. One of
the first SSH clients on iOS was iSSH, which I used many years ago. After this,
Panic released a professional class application called <a href="https://panic.com/prompt/">Prompt</a>. Prompt is
what I&rsquo;ve happily used for the last few years, but the 10 minute background
process limit is a constant pain. Just a quick switch away for a few minutes,
and you have to reconnect. That&rsquo;s fine once or twice, but when it happens many
times it seriously slows your productivity.</p>
<p><img src="../img/16/tmux.png" alt="Tmux session writing this post in Vim" title="Writing this blog post in Vim in Tmux"></p>
<p>Of course an obvious solution to this is something like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a> or
<a href="https://tmux.github.io">Tmux</a>. I&rsquo;ve also used Tmux for the last few years and I&rsquo;ve found it
indispensible to working remotely on my iPad, to try get any sort of programming
done. While I love <a href="https://panic.com/prompt/">Prompt</a>, and it is a very well designed app, I couldn&rsquo;t
get much done on the go on my home machine over <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>.</p>
<p>That is until I rediscovered <a href="https://mosh.org">Mosh</a>. Mosh is an MIT project that redesigns the
shell for the 21st Century (unreliable mobile internet connections). I&rsquo;d seen
this project a few years back, but it had no mobile (Android or iOS) client at
that stage and was purely experimental. It now has very wide platform support,
including a new(-ish) iOS app called <a href="http://www.blink.sh">Blink</a>. The major benefit of mosh is
that it doesn&rsquo;t need root to install, uses existing SSH connections to set
itself up and doesn&rsquo;t need a constant connection. This differs hugely from
Prompt in terms of usability, no more 10 minute session timeouts, you reconnect
instantly using a very efficient UDP protocol Mosh uses (on a port between
60,000-61,000). It all just feels very effortless.</p>
<p>That said, there are still issues around scrollback buffer and connecting to
multiple sessions with Tmux. Scrollback sometimes gets garbled with Mosh/Blink,
and it is a known issue of Mosh. Also Tmux sizes itself based on the client
which connects, which is fine if you connect with one device. Connect with
multiple devices of different resolutions (phone, tablet, laptop) and you&rsquo;ll see
wasted space abound. So while the potential of Mosh is still great, I still feel
it is in the early adopter phase. If you like the future and can handle the
rough edges, definitely give it a shot.</p>
