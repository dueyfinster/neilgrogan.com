9/11][]. It is easily the most powerful about the event, much more so than
Fahrenheit 9/11. In fact I would even argue, that if this documentary had of
aired during the U.S. presedential election, I would have bet on a different
result. Backed up by trusted resources such as the <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm title="BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well">BBC which confirmed at
least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well</a>. Filled with outrageous
facts, it sets the scene for either a highly competent Bush regime that new
what it was doing, or the worst domestic tragedy that happend under
maladministration. Either way the American people have serious questions to
ask, which I hope in time will get the aired in time. Maybe George W. is
taking a leaf out of Charlie Haugheys book? That is that corruption can be a
force for the good of the public, and my rich friends?</p><p>Also I would like to unreservedly apologize that this site has been down for
so long. The thing is my ex-hosting provider, which I won’t even honor with a
link, was an incompetent mess. I have now moved to an Irish company,
Hosting365.ie, which gives me freephone support all for a little extra money.
Also their premises is in Dublin, which means I can call in at any time and I
get the protection of Irish Law (even though we know its a mess [e.g. Mr.A
child abuser being set free], I still think we have an alright civil liberties
protection, even though I know nothing about law, so I am most likely
misguided, anyhoo!) of course not without paying the 21% VAT, which needs to
be lowered might I add.</p><p>This isn’t my usual tech babble I know, but I’ll end this post with the news
that I am BETA testing the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet Edition 2006 [maemo.org].
It rocks so hard, I can’t even begin to say&mldr; First of theirs GoogleTalk built
in, with support for SIP (might be from Gizmo). Notwithstanding that, their
are cool native applications such as MaemoPad Plus [Sketch/Notes] and
MaemoMapper [GPS+ Google Maps]. Somehow they have squeezed more battery life
out of this gadget, and now you can create a swap on the memory card, meaning
its, I’d say (pure speculation, obviously) 80% more efficient. Warning to
people who actually use the 770 for important stuff, don’t upgrade until Nokia
has released it, as it is very buggy, with applications crashing [somewhat]
alot. Wait until all of us in the know, report those pesky bugs! But a real
geek can see through the flaws and see the Nokia 770 for what it is, a truly
cool Internet tool.</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
