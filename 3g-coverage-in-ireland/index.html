post about my journey on public transport from Kilkenny to Dublin. For
people outside of Ireland the total Journey distance was about 90
miles.</p><p>I used only my iPhone on the O2 network and close to 50% of the time it
seemed like I had 3G. This was on a train moving at speed, and YouTube
played very well with little to no stutter. It did drop to Edge the
other half of the time, with about 30% of time I still got speeds web
browsing was acceptable on. So in summary: 80% of the time it was
possible to surf the web.</p><p>After that Journey I was also on a Dublin Bus, and I had full 3G
coverage which comes as little surprise as Dublin Bus only serves densly
populated Dublin and it&rsquo;s environs.</p><p>A few days later I went on a road trip to Athlone, and the coverage on
the M4/M6 was not as good as I&rsquo;d hoped. My theory on why the train was
better is the fact on the routes I&rsquo;ve been on a lot more urban areas are
visited, thus the rollout has been very good to densely populated towns,
but along motorways which are far away from such places: your sadly out
of luck.</p><p>Hutchinson Whampoa (aka 3 Ireland) have recently got the national
broadband contract to supply rural areas with 3G coverage, so most of
these areas should be covered in the next few years. I should note
wireless broadband is hugely needed for mobiles etc,, but a fiber optic
service is really what the government should be sticking money into!</p><p>Overall I am very happy to recommend 3G for mobile usage with small
devices. People with Laptops should explore their options and try find
something else first, like DSL, Cable or fixed point wireless. These can
be slightly more expensive then bargain-basement 3G but worth it. As the
old adage goes: sometimes you get what you pay for&mldr;</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/hardware>#hardware</a>
