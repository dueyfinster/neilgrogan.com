<em>Cloud Computing</em> doesn&rsquo;t actually mean anything specific (or could mean a lot of
things). It&rsquo;s that a lot of things to a lot of people who makes it useful as a term, an 
ideology, a way of explaining why <em>you-oh-so-need-to-do-this-now</em>. Cloud computing
for me is a platform description. I think of the myriad of hosting companies who offer
a platform to build your service atop.</p><p>Technology has been and will continue to be all about platforms. Look at Windows, the
perfect example of an &ldquo;<em>open</em>&rdquo; platform that is actually <em>very, very closed</em>.
Open in the sense it makes you feel fuzzy inside with all the control you seem to have.
But closed when the platform operator decides they need a change of direction and
emphasis. If your smart, you realise this and either a) kick the football down the
road or b) do your best to plan ahead. Either option is sub-optimal. What platforms
do offer you is a foundation to build upon. They save you time, money, engineering
talent and when they work well are indispensable.</p><p>If you build the platform, you can make a lot of money. Just ask Amazon and Microsoft.
Facebook, Twitter and Google are still ramping up their platform efforts. Adobe has
just announced the realised their very valuable Flash platform is dead on mobile devices.
They realised platforms are very purpose specific (to be valuable) and that value is in
the already-mature desktop market - the investment in mobile wasn&rsquo;t worth it. Adobe
has always made money from the tools (as has Microsoft, apart from selling the
platform Windows they sell Office, Sharepoint etc) and is focusing on targeting a
larger platform in HTML5. If Adobe succeeds they&rsquo;ll make a lot more money, or even
if they capture a small section of the market which is bigger then the previous
flash creation tools market.</p><p>Monetisation is also tricky for platforms. Amazon&rsquo;s strategy is similar to Wal-Mart,
make it big, reliable and cheap. Only big companies can ever compete with Amazon on
that scale. Smaller companies must rely on getting as many people to their platform
as possible (to get as big) or creating a niche in say highly regulated environments
which are high value but low volume.</p><p>In short: Platforms are good, but know when to jump off !</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/google>#google</a>
