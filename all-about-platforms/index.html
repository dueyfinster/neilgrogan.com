        <p>
        <p>If your passion is in technology, you often sigh with the marketing buzzwords
used in sales. <em>Cloud Computing</em> doesn&rsquo;t actually mean anything specific
(or could mean a lot of things). It&rsquo;s that a lot of things to a lot of people
who makes it useful as a term, an  ideology, a way of explaining why
<em>you-oh-so-need-to-do-this-now</em>. Cloud computing for me is a platform
description. I think of the myriad of hosting companies who offer a platform to
build your service atop.</p>
<p>Technology has been and will continue to be all about platforms. Look at
Windows, the perfect example of an &ldquo;<em>open</em>&rdquo; platform that is actually
<em>very, very closed</em>. Open in the sense it makes you feel fuzzy inside
with all the control you seem to have. But closed when the platform operator
decides they need a change of direction and emphasis. If your smart, you realise
this and either a) kick the football down the road or b) do your best to plan
ahead. Either option is sub-optimal. What platforms do offer you is a foundation
to build upon. They save you time, money, engineering talent and when they work
well are indispensable.</p>
<p>If you build the platform, you can make a lot of money. Just ask Amazon and
Microsoft. Facebook, Twitter and Google are still ramping up their platform
efforts. Adobe has just announced the realised their very valuable Flash
platform is dead on mobile devices. They realised platforms are very purpose
specific (to be valuable) and that value is in the already-mature desktop
market - the investment in mobile wasn&rsquo;t worth it. Adobe has always made money
from the tools (as has Microsoft, apart from selling the platform Windows they
sell Office, Sharepoint etc) and is focusing on targeting a larger platform in
HTML5. If Adobe succeeds they&rsquo;ll make a lot more money, or even if they capture
a small section of the market which is bigger then the previous flash creation
tools market.</p>
<p>Monetisation is also tricky for platforms. Amazon&rsquo;s strategy is similar to
Wal-Mart, make it big, reliable and cheap. Only big companies can ever compete
with Amazon on that scale. Smaller companies must rely on getting as many people
to their platform as possible (to get as big) or creating a niche in say highly
regulated environments which are high value but low volume.</p>
<p>In short: Platforms are good, but know when to jump off !</p>
