<h1 class="post-title">Nokia 770 Internet Tablet</h1>
    
    <time>December 23, 2005</time>
    

    <div>
        
        <p>
        <p>I got it! UPS delivered the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet. What can I say? It is
pure magic! The features are great, it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Browser (Opera)</li>
<li>Flash Player version 6</li>
<li>Email Client</li>
<li>Internet Radio</li>
<li>News Reader</li>
<li>Media players, Image viewer</li>
<li>PDF viewer</li>
<li>File Manager</li>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Calculator</li>
<li>World Clock</li>
<li>Notes</li>
<li>Sketch</li>
<li>Games</li>
</ul>
<p>It runs on Linux, making it totally extendable. It even has its own developer
site at maemo.org, where applications can be downloaded. Hot  on my list were
Doom (the Game) and GAIM (Instant Messenger, uses Google Talk, AOL, MSN,
Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, etc). Unfortunately their is no Skype for Nokia 770 just
yet, but hopefully it will be here soon. Nokia has promised an upgrade in
2006, that will include VOIP, such as skype.</p>
<p>All major formats have good support on the Nokia 770, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio: MP3, MPEG4-AAC, WAV, AMR, MP2, [OGG - (With download from Maemo)]</li>
<li>Image: JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, PNG, Animated GIF format, SVG-tiny, ICO</li>
<li>Video: MPEG1, MPEG4, Real Video, H.263, AVI, 3GP</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as I took it out of the package, within minutes I was surfing,  the
only delay was trying to find MAC address (as my router uses access  control
list) which I eventually found underneath the battery. I thought this was a
bit odd as Mac Address&rsquo; are easily attainable when it is connected to a
network, so hopefully Nokia will revise this! The media card is also only
64mb, which gives a total free of about 108mb space. RS-MMC (The media card it
uses) only come in prohibitive sizes and are expensive, this will most likely
change if it is widely used. The stand that comes with it is the most
difficult part of the package! It took me 20mins to try and figure out how to
use the stand. All in all it is not a great stand, just two lumps of plastic.
The battery seems respectable at the moment, with a predicted time of three
hours battery life and seven days standby. I got a bit more then three hours
when I first opened it, it worked out just a little over 3hrs 20mins. Not bad
for a 2/3 full battery Nokia packs with new devices!</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, reviews are excellent for it. A lot of noise is made  of the
fact that it is so customisable and that all of the programs for it are free!
Abiword is also a must have, it opens and edits documents. It compared to
other tablets is quite cheap, at about â‚¬369 including delivery, in Ireland.</p>
<p>I will be posting updates on my free Wifi testing campaign soon, its all about
to kick off! I will let you know best free wifi spots in and around Dublin
area!</p>
<p>Anywhere you think I should go? Please tell me, it will be useful!</p>
