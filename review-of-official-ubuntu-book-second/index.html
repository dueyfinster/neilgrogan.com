Ubuntu Book (2nd Edition) is a nicely put together book for dealing with
the Linux operating system in a number of clearly laid out and well
presented chapters. Chapters are as follows:</p><ol><li>Introducing Ubuntu</li><li>Installing Ubuntu</li><li>Using Ubuntu on the Desktop</li><li>Advanced Usage and Managing Ubuntu</li><li>Ubuntu Server</li><li>Support / Typical Problems</li><li>Using Kubuntu</li><li>Ubuntu Community</li><li>Ubuntu-Related Projects</li><li>Using Edubuntu</li></ol><p>This book is a very complete introduction and contains suprising
elements related to finding out and joining the community of users -
which you will not find in other Ubuntu Books (such as O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Ubuntu
Hacks) which make it a unique and worthwhile addition to any Ubuntu
users personal library. It is most helpful to new users to Ubuntu, which
sections on installing and help with problems that could be faced.
Having said that, it falls short on the amount of truly unique
information that it contains - most of the books contents can be found
on the web. What you are paying for is a well-laid out, well written
account of the Ubuntu-sphere and all that goes along with it.</p><p>The price of â‚¬37.50 which I paid (less in the US, about $34.99 RRP)
might be a bit much for some, but when you consider the operating system
itself is free, you can easily justify the cost. A DVD comes included
with the book which contains Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu, rather handy
if you do not want to download the cd image.</p><p>The Server section is obviously a bit more for the advanced user, but
still is a quint introduction to the basics which is 34 pages long -
probably not enough to warrant a purchase by a sever administrator or
other power server user. The Edubuntu section offers an introduction to
the school-based flavour of Ubuntu which tips on how they differ and
administration of multiple machines (including a nice introduction to
thin clients and servers for schools).</p><p>Whos the book for?<br>People new to Ubuntu, people moving from Windows, School Administrators
all fit the test case. If your an Ubuntu power user, don&rsquo;t mind taking
down your system or messing with the kernel than you should stick to
online help. However I bought the book to show to others and promote
Ubuntu as a viable and successful alternative to Mac OS X and Windows -
it gives a great impression of the project and it&rsquo;s success to date and
I also bought it to support Ubuntu financially.</p><p>My Rating: 8.5/10</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/book>#book</a>
