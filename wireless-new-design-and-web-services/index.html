As I mentioned before, I hope
to receive a Nokia 770 Internet Tablet soon, so I will be checking the free
wireless services offered by Eircom in Dublin and at McDonalds restaurants.</p><p>You may have noticed the new look and this revamped blog. You may also
question where has Duey Finsters Web Services gone? It is still here, but me
and Thomas Whelan, who run it, cannot decide on a name. Maybe you all could
help us out? Since well over 97% of all the words in the dictionary are
registered as dot coms, we have no clue what to call ourselves.</p><p>We are looking for a unique name, that could be trademarked, so anything you
suggest, you give us permission to use royalty-free (We might throw you a
million, when we make ours). Once we get a name, the dot com will be
registered and a totally new site will be designed.</p><p>Also new is a guides section, which will be part of the blog. The idea is I
can write guides so other people can see how easy it is to actually do stuff.
I plan to write a guide (Including pictures) for Linux and Windows using
encrypted mail. On Linux, I will show both command and KGPG (the KDE graphical
key maker) and on windows I will use WinPT (Windows Privacy Tools).</p><p>The Music and Bookmarks section are going to take a while for me to implement
properly, as I am still practicing using PHP to render XML, but it should be
fun. They both use feeds, Last.fm for music and del.icio.us for bookmarks.
That reminds me, I just saw del.icio.us was bought by Yahoo!, I hope they do
not ruin it like they did to Flickr and stick their name and advertising in
every conceivable space on the page.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/security>#security</a></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><script src=../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
