Gaelic Sport of hurling. I mean as my previous posts mention I have
moved to Kilkenny; and rural South Kilkenny at that. They live and
breath Hurling down here: it&rsquo;s literally a way of life. That is why they
are so good; no mystery here folks: its is literally bred into children
in schools and everyone plays it. More people playing means even though
Kilkenny is only around 100,000 people it still has a large amount of
people to pick from and they get the best training which equals the best
results.</p><p>The City&rsquo;s mayor Pat Crotty said (paraphrased as I read it and cannot
find the quote): &ldquo;People say Kilkenny winning all the time is bad for
hurling, not with displays like that&rdquo;. That is referring to the utter
decimation of the county that adjoins South Kilkenny: Waterford. They
were beaten by the biggest scoreline in over 50 years I think it was;
yes it was a savage display. I speak as a Kildare man from a county that
has achieved little to no success (sorry lads lets face facts!); and I
wish they would emulate Kilkenny&rsquo;s prowess and agility. The press raved
about how it was the best display of Hurling this century. As things go
I was working; but the vibe was unreal. I was also working when over
25,000 people showed up to greet them home.</p><p>Anyways in South Kilkenny where my folks live is called Danesfort; and
to prove how into Hurling they are they even have a song (bear in mind
this is not a town or village; its basically a pub, church and houseS
with less than 80 people living here); proof if it&rsquo;s needed Kilkenny are
mental about Hurling:</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
