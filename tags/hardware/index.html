<p>It&rsquo;s the ultimate work computer in many ways, always with you, light enough and comfortable enough for real work™. The keyboard shortcuts in iOS have improved massively from iOS 8 to iOS 9 to the point of actually being useful and the split screen view is actually rather nice to use (I never &ldquo;got&rdquo; it on a Mac).</p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>Early last year, I purchased two <a href="http://codekeyboards.com">Code Keyboards</a> (one for work and one for home). The Code Keyboards are designed by <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com">Jeff Atwood</a> (who founded <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>). Mechanical keyboards are “old style” in that the switches are from an era where everything was mechanical, unlike today where everything is glass. So mechanical keyboards have ardent fans and people who don’t really care for them.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/16/code_kb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I did a lot of research before I purchased, talking to various people in work who are very knowledgeable about mechanical keyboards (The best community for advice, discussion and group buys is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards">/r/mechanicalkeyboards</a> on reddit.). The variety of hardware and opinions is positively mind melting. If you are doing your own research, you should definitely come across <a href="http://cherryswitches.com">Cherry switches</a> (a very established German brand). Switches are what sit between your key that you see (with the letter printed on top) and the electronic board that converts the key press to a signal the computer can understand.</p></p>

                <p><p>I backed the Roost laptop stand on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.org">Kickstarter</a>,
which already had a successful run in their first Kickstarter campaign. I&rsquo;ve
been delighted with the result so far, it lives up to the promises of being
super light but yet durable and strong. Here&rsquo;s a photo of it:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/16/roost.png" alt="Roost Laptop stand holding a macbook" title="Roost Stand"></p>
<p>It came with a really nice case which holds the Roost underneath and has pockets
for a portable keyboard (I use a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/illuminated-keyboard-for-mac-ipad-iphone">Logitech
K811</a>)
and mouse (I use a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/marathon-mouse-m705">Logitech Marathon

great for a really comfortable and ergonomic desk wherever you may travel (or
set up to work). Highly recommended!</p></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for more, I would have a look at the more expensive models. When I shopped around at the time, I read that the internals of this machine are just as good as the ones that DeLonghi sells that are twice as expensive. Mostly the price difference comes down to the &ldquo;extraneous&rdquo; features. Where this machine falls down is in a few areas:</p></p>

                <p><p>I recently bought the wifi version of the Motorola Xoom. I did not get the 3G version to
keep costs down (no second carrier subscription in addition to smartphone I own). Here&rsquo;s
my review, let it be noted I&rsquo;ve been an iOS user since version 2 (iPhone 3G) and although
I have used devices from Android 1.6 and up - I&rsquo;ve never &rsquo;lived&rsquo; with them.</p>

<h2 id="aesthetics--design">Aesthetics &amp; Design</h2>
<p>First of all the design is very well executed. It looks and feels like a premium tablet
should (should that be iPad competitor?). The ports are a clear winner and still are over
any other tablet. I haven&rsquo;t got the video dock yet, but I ampositiveit&rsquo;ll be
a great addition to my big HDTV. The only gripe really is that it doesn&rsquo;t charge through
usb, which I believe is because it has two batteries. It charges through supplied plug
insanely fast! It lasts all day and then some with heavy use also. I haven&rsquo;t left the
thing alone long enough to test the standby time, but I am sure it&rsquo;s good also. The 10.1&quot;
screen feels like the &lsquo;right&rsquo; size for a tablet and I&rsquo;ll besurprisedif more
tablets don&rsquo;t end up adopting a screen size closer to the Xoom&rsquo;s. The heft is a bit much,
I would like it to be a small bit lighter - but nearly all tablets with proper glass
screens will be heavy.</p></p>

                <p><p>I got a Plantronics .655 USB Headset mainly for the ability to do VOIP well.
Those of you who come here often know <a href="http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/03/review.html">I reviewed Sennheiser HD595 before</a>,
which is a headset built for the quality of reproduction (I use that one for music).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much you can say about a VOIP headset, so I am going to keep this short!
The Plantronics .655 USB isn&rsquo;t the most comfortable headset and the usb connection
seemed like a plus as I&rsquo;d never owned a USB headset. The mic quality is a lot better
with the USB connection (though I am guessing 90% is down to the fact it&rsquo;s directional
and pointed at your mouth), but the sound won&rsquo;t be.</p></p>

great product for Audiophiles. I have to say for someone who constantly
listens to a lot of music - good headphones like these are a must. They
are expensive for sure, but Sennheiser do seem to have a great durability
and solid build quality. This is my first set of such high quality headphones,
so bear that in mind - I can&rsquo;t speak for other manufacturers in this space.</p></p>

bigger bikes that have loads of built in storage (panniers look a bit

think so! Got one there 2 months ago and forgot to write a blog post

theory has yet to be tested (I&rsquo;ll wait for a year to be up). As I
mentioned before in previous posts my parent&rsquo;s house is now in a remote
location with no train/buses anywhere nearby. So transport was
essential! At this time also there was a major crack down on learner
drivers not being accompanied by a fully licensed driver (of two years).
So by the time I&rsquo;d saved the money for the car; got 10 lessons and
convinced anyone I knew with over two years full driving experience to
accompany me; even to work - was just to much hassle - hence the moped
which has no such onerous requirements. In fact only one it does really
have is that you can&rsquo;t have passengers - I won&rsquo;t be carrying anyone
anyways - so I am not too bothered. Anyhoo take a look at the photos I
took when I got it. I have done it up since then: new tyres, resprayed
exhaust, full service; new mirrors; repaired exhaust; flushed out
radiator and put in proper coolant just to name a few. So it sounds
allot better and drives better than ever!</p></p>

right than the N770 which I thought had the best design of all (be it

<p>(Picture Courtesy: <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/10/17/the-nokia-n810-internet-tablet/">Internet Tablet
Talk</a>)</p>
<p>It sports a nice new hardware keyboard; inbuilt GPS (For satellite
mapping) and OS 2008 (an upgrade to the operating system it runs). The
N800 will also benefit from OS 2008, which will include GoogleTalk,
Skype, Mozilla browser, among the usual such as its email client, media
player, file manager, control panel, assorted games and an image/PDF
viewer. The one feature it will emit is an inbuilt FM Radio, which was
axed to make the N810 a smaller tablet. It still retains the best screen
size for web browsing, bluetooth connectivity, and of course Wifi which

                <p><p>Planning to build a computer can be fun also. Researching parts, making
sure they work well together (if they are on Manufacturers QVL). Making
a list of all the parts you need is the beginning of the purchasing,
assembly and then seeing your machine in action! Lots of guides online
help with the planning stage; but nearly all are advice and tips. How do
you know which is biased? Are the benchmarks relevant to what you are
building your machine for? Probably not most of the time. If you&rsquo;re not
a hardcore gamer like myself, your machine can mid-range and cheaper
than a pre-built solution, saving you money. I am using my machine as a
long term investment: I plan to have it long into the future and just
replace components. I think that could save me at least €3000 over ten
years (two €1,500 machines every 5 years, not beyond possibility) if not
more. I can also re-use perfectly good parts when my other machines have
departed to that big waste recycling plant in the sky.</p></p>

                <p><p>I found a new pastime: dismantling pc&rsquo;s. It my not sound like great
fun, but its a challenge to do it right and make sure you don&rsquo;t break
your pc at the end of it all. Nothing feels of so much relief when you
see the BIOS boot up again after ripping everything you can out and
cramming it all back in. It stands to you in developing problem solving
skills, which of course employers love. It is so much more visual than
any theory, plus it is what the majority of people like: physical
objects like Lego going together. I am writing this on a computer I
stripped everything out of at the moment: a Dell 3100c, a Celeron D
machine I bought in August of last year. Today I dismantled a very old
Optiplex PIII, and the difference between the machines is marked, even
though there are only a few years between them. I have included some
photos below to show the inside internals:</p></p>

I just tried Herd 5 of Gutsy Gibbon, a beta release which will be Ubuntu
07.10 released in October. Obviously it is still early stages and a lot
of things aren&rsquo;t working quite as they should, but it looks very
promising. Here&rsquo;s some new stuff which should hit the final release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiz Fusion - Pretty Graphics that leave you in awe&hellip;</li>
<li>Bullet Proof X - Making sure you&rsquo;ll never see a terminal prompt not
of your own choosing, basically the graphics server should be
&lsquo;bulletproof&rsquo;</li>
<li>Appearance Manager - Making it easier to change yourbuntu&rsquo;s look and
feel</li>
<li>Better Driver Support - More of those restricted drivers to make
sure you can see your screen and use your wifi card</li>
<li>Simplified Codecs install - It will now be painless, install
ubuntu-restrictedcodecs (or kubuntu-restricted codecs) and you can
see Youtube in all its glory, play a dvd, watch that porno WMV file
(just kidding but I think thats all WMV is used for) and other such
niceties of the propreitry world we have to put up with</li>
<li>Firefox Codecs Plugin - Firefox will be hooked up to the package
manager and prompt to install Flash/Java if you haven&rsquo;t got it
already, much the same way it prompts to get a codec when you throw
a file at it that it cannot play in the movie player. The free
software Gnash replacement for Flash will come as standard and can
play Youtube Vids.</li>
<li>Dual Screen Glory - If your like me you have a nice and small
portable laptop, but that screen just won&rsquo;t do all of the time,
thats why I personally have a 19&quot; to plug my 13&quot; MacBook into. With
Gutsy I should be able to plug and play over DVI.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the features that are being worked on for the
final release. Probably not all of them on the list will get into Gutsy
final, but lets hope they do! Gutsy+1 (slated for release April 2008)
has been announced as &ldquo;Hardy Hereon&rdquo; and should be a long term release
(5 years server and 3 years desktop updates and
patches).<a href="http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg" alt="image"></a></p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>I just bought a HP Photosmart R927, an 8 Megapixel camera from
Hewlett-Packard. While I had seen and briefly used one before, I was
excited again upon using my own one (as all tech people are [read:
geeks]). First of all don&rsquo;t confuse me as anyway into photography: I&rsquo;m
not and far from it. I had a criteria in mind when I purchased and this
was it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must work under any OS (Windows [a given], Mac and Linux [latter two
I only use])</li>
</ul>
<p>Every camera I have come across mounts as a disc drive [think looking at
files on a cd or your local computer], but there is also PTP or &ldquo;Picture
Transfer Protocol&rdquo; in other words it doesn&rsquo;t appear as picture files,
rather PTP triggers your computer to open your camera in your photo
application. I was unsure if this PTP would work under Mac or Linux,
since I had only briefly seen it as an option in
<a href="http://www.digikam.org/">digiKam</a>. It turns out on Mac there is <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/imagecapture/">Image
Capture</a>, and Ubuntu
(My Linux distribution of choice) it automatically detects it and asks
to import photos into<a href="http://f-spot.org/">F-Spot</a>.</p></p>

unfortunately its Mac specific, but really only iSquint program is, so
if anyone can suggest a replacement on Windows or Linux, I will add it
to the details of the video. I use Garageband for audio, iMovieHD to
edit the video and audio and Copernicus to record my screen. I started
by getting everything I needed ready (all the Firefox tabs etc.) and hit
record in Copernicus. I imported that .mov into iMovieHD, and then
proceeded to open Garageband, watch the video and talk myself through my
own recording. I saved the voice part in Garageband, exported it and
then imported it into iMovie. I checked to make sure the audio and video
lined up perefectly (what I done on screen matched what I was saying)
and then exported it as a .mov from iMovieHD. Then I uploaded the result
to Youtube, which I think for a first try ain&rsquo;t bad!! Watch it here:</p></p>

me describing my living quarters and about my laptop. I needed to be a bit
closer to the phone as hearing me is difficult sometimes (not so in real

won&rsquo;t sync address+calendar with my macbook :-( (My old phone did just that

<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.mactivate.ie/">Mactivate</a> got it wrong, it wasn&rsquo;t the
heatsink, <a href="../../2006/11/01/macbook-issue-identified.html">as referred to by my earlier post</a>. Looks like I have seen good
advice from the Web, never buy a first generation <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> product, until
they work out the kinks! I guess Mactivate have been snowed under with
heatsink problems, that they never bothered to check other parts of my
Macbook, since it is such a common problem.They have ordered me a new &ldquo;logic
board&rdquo; (I am guessing the <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319">PMU</a> like I thought it was ;-) ). In other news
<a href="http://www.macfixit.com/article.php/2006110107475681#">Apple released a firmware update</a> for those poor unfortunates that have
been suffering Random Shutdown Syndrome (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)">RSS</a>) for short :-D ).
Hopefully I should have it back by this Tuesday (November 7th) plus a new
heatsink and logic board&hellip;. fingers crossed anyway!</p></p>

random shutdowns like the ones that have been widely reported across the web.
it was like I described in my earlier post, something to do with the battery
not being able to charge. Then again, I am no expert on this and their is wide
evidence (over 1600 people have identified heatsink as a problem in their
Macbooks) that the heatsink is a definite issue. Sounds like good or bad I
will have a lot more to say about Apple Computer in the future, thats why I
have decided to add them as a category.</p></p>

site at maemo.org, where applications can be downloaded. Hot  on my list were
Doom (the Game) and GAIM (Instant Messenger, uses Google Talk, AOL, MSN,
Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, etc). Unfortunately their is no Skype for Nokia 770 just
yet, but hopefully it will be here soon. Nokia has promised an upgrade in
