So far I am really glad I did, the computer comes with me everywhere. I bring it to work, to visit family, on trips and everywhere in between.
It&rsquo;s the ultimate work computer in many ways, always with you, light enough and comfortable enough for real work™. The keyboard shortcuts in iOS have improved massively from iOS 8 to iOS 9 to the point of actually being useful and the split screen view is actually rather nice to use (I never &ldquo;got&rdquo; it on a Mac).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 13, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../mech-kb/>Mechanical Keyboards</a></h2><div><p>Early last year, I purchased two Code Keyboards (one for work and one for home). The Code Keyboards are designed by Jeff Atwood (who founded Stack Overflow). Mechanical keyboards are “old style” in that the switches are from an era where everything was mechanical, unlike today where everything is glass. So mechanical keyboards have ardent fans and people who don’t really care for them.
I did a lot of research before I purchased, talking to various people in work who are very knowledgeable about mechanical keyboards (The best community for advice, discussion and group buys is /r/mechanicalkeyboards on reddit.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 15, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../roost-stand/>Roost Laptop Stand</a></h2><div><p>I backed the Roost laptop stand on Kickstarter, which already had a successful run in their first Kickstarter campaign. I&rsquo;ve been delighted with the result so far, it lives up to the promises of being super light but yet durable and strong. Here&rsquo;s a photo of it:
It came with a really nice case which holds the Roost underneath and has pockets for a portable keyboard (I use a Logitech K811) and mouse (I use a Logitech Marathon M705).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 15, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../watch-stand/>Apple Watch Stand</a></h2><div><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e1DiEegB_c

It was the best rated coffee machine (at time of purchase) on Amazon and it doesn&rsquo;t dissapoint. For the purpose, it&rsquo;s wonderful:
Make great coffee fast, without a mess.
If you&rsquo;re looking for more, I would have a look at the more expensive models.

Cloud Computing doesn&rsquo;t actually mean anything specific (or could mean a lot of things). It&rsquo;s that a lot of things to a lot of people who makes it useful as a term, an ideology, a way of explaining why you-oh-so-need-to-do-this-now. Cloud computing for me is a platform description.

Those of you who come here often know I reviewed Sennheiser HD595 before, which is a headset built for the quality of reproduction (I use that one for music).
There&rsquo;s not much you can say about a VOIP headset, so I am going to keep this short! The Plantronics .655 USB isn&rsquo;t the most comfortable headset and the usb connection seemed like a plus as I&rsquo;d never owned a USB headset.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 16, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../cleaning-your-ps3s-fans/>Cleaning your PS3's fans?</a></h2><div><p>Below is a neat trick to clean out your Playstation 3&rsquo;s fans if they become a bit noisy.

I have to say for someone who constantly listens to a lot of music - good headphones like these are a must. They are expensive for sure, but Sennheiser do seem to have a great durability and solid build quality. This is my first set of such high quality headphones, so bear that in mind - I can&rsquo;t speak for other manufacturers in this space.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 5, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../iphone4-review/>iPhone 4 Review</a></h2><div><p>I purchased the iPhone 4 shortly after its release in Summer 2010. I have obviously been so quick to review this device, the iPhone 5 is upon us! My philosophy for reviewing items is you have to live with them. Well boy have I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do marvel at how good the hardware is. I&rsquo;ve dropped this extremely expensive device on occasions too numerous to count, so luckily it is designed well.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 18, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../ipad-evolution/>iPad Evolution?</a></h2><div><p>Since Apple released an iPad there have been various competitors announced, so it got me thinking what would it take for me to buy one? I haven&rsquo;t bought the first generation iPad because the lack of a camera on a device so obviously good for fullscreen video calls has baffled me. I guess they have to store up some ideas since they need a new hardware iteration every year, Apple&rsquo;s revenue model depends on that vital hardware refresh cycle.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 26, 2010</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../motorcycle-gps/>Garmin Zumo 660 Motorcycle GPS</a></h2><div><p>It&rsquo;s been over a week since I received my Garmin Zumo 660 Motorcycle GPS unit. I thought I&rsquo;d give it a run-down for potential buyers on my experience for the first week. Firstly I should mention, I&rsquo;ve never owned another Garmin unit, and had two mobile GPS&rsquo; units before (one being Nokia N800 with Bluetooth external GPS and other Apple iPhone 3G). The reason I bring this up is that a lot of the reviews I&rsquo;ve seen written compare it to it&rsquo;s predecessor, Zumo 550, which obviously I can&rsquo;t do.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 4, 2010</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../honda-bros-motorcycle/>Honda Bros Motorcycle</a></h2><div><p>I recently purchased - known as a cult motorbike - a Honda BROS (known in the US as a HawkGT).

I used only my iPhone on the O2 network and close to 50% of the time it seemed like I had 3G. This was on a train moving at speed, and YouTube played very well with little to no stutter.
