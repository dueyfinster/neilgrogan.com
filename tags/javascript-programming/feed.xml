I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with JavaScript, apart from a course in work, which was focused on the language itself and jQuery. React is a front end framework, which allows you to build reusable components (and generate them with data.)
The only real experience I have is writing an application (using Node.js) for my MSc course which was an AJAX application for interacting with Amazon SimpleDB.</description></item><item><title>Full Stack Web Application with Node.js Tutorial</title><link>https://www.neilgrogan.com/web-app-nodejs-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.neilgrogan.com/web-app-nodejs-tutorial/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve followed this tutorial personally, not using Mongo as the database at first. It&amp;rsquo;s clear and to the point and provides just what you need to know to get started. Highly recommended.</description></item></channel></rss>
