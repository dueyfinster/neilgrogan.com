by david.given (6740)
France generates pretty much all of its electricity from nuclear, with reprocessing, using pressurised water reactors. Not only do they have a number of handy engineering benefits such as isolating the water loop through the reactor from the water loop through the turbines, but they also have a particularly useful safety feature in that they&rsquo;re self-regulating &mdash; temperature goes up, power output goes down.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 28, 2009</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../threats-to-democracy/>Threats to Democracy</a></h2><div><p>After reading about Tom Cruise being banned from filming at certain German military sites because of his belief in Scientology, I was a bit outraged at first, despite my abhorrence of their beliefs, which I think are crazy and nonsensical.
Germany has barred the makers of a movie about a plot to kill Adolf Hitler from filming at German military sites because its star Tom Cruise is a Scientologist, the Defence Ministry said on Monday.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 26, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../irish-elections-creative-commons/>Irish Elections and Creative Commons</a></h2><div><p>This is the text of an email I sent to RTE.

People nowadays define their own law on the Web and the Internet (don’t know the difference, you should), while disregarding real life. Maybe its a lack of understanding about technology or law, I don’t know. One things for sure, common sense can go a long way.

Fell free to email your opinions to them directly: ** DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov**. As a net citizen, get your voice heard on the most important public debate of our times! Dear Sir/Madam, I, as a citizen of Ireland and the EU, think with respect, the Internet should have a world governing body, fairly appointed by each country who has more than 30% of their respective populations online.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 3, 2006</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../questions-hosting-and-it-2006/>Questions, Hosting and IT 2006!</a></h2><div><p>I recently found a great documentary, about 9/11, entitled Loose Change 9/11][]. It is easily the most powerful about the event, much more so than Fahrenheit 9/11. In fact I would even argue, that if this documentary had of aired during the U.S. presedential election, I would have bet on a different result. Backed up by trusted resources such as the BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 23, 2006</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../nuclear-or-nothing/>Nuclear or Nothing?</a></h2><div><p>In Ireland we, like the rest of the world, have though questions to answer. Ireland being an island economy, is especially reliant on oil, none of which we produce. I was surprised earlier this week to hear one of George W. Bush’s top aides, saying that the U.S. needs to lose dependence on foreign oil and research alternatives. I was never more shocked, to hear Bush’s change of heart, from using improved technology, to one of his aides saying they need to use less oil.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 11, 2006</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../europes-new-voice/>Europe's New Voice</a></h2><div><p>As tech savvy readers will be aware, dot EU is the latest domain to go into public use.

A lot has happened since then, with Danish cartoons, Dublin Riots and a few policy changes to the site. First of all the cartoons, I mean, whats all the fuss? Christianity is banned in Saudi Arabia and Muslims in the middle east just don’t get the idea of ‘free press’. No one should be allowed to immigrate to the western world, if they do not hold the core values which we hold, such as human rights, free of expression/press and other values.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 2, 2006</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../new-year-lets-review/>New Year, Lets Review!</a></h2><div><p>Well another year has passed, so I thought I’d make a short recap of it, and tell you what I am looking forward to in 2006. The year was firmly in the hands of mother nature as we saw in both Pakistan, New Orleans/Gulf of Mexico and the Tsunami’s after effects. International consensus was reached at the G8 as London was being bombed - not by the IRA, but by their new enemies in the middle east.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 6, 2006</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../eurosceptics/>Eurosceptics</a></h2><div><p>The British Press annoys me so much, they way they constantly get it wrong across the board about the EU. I am a fond supporter of the EU for all its faults and cracks. But I love freedom of the press and like organisations who uphold basic journalistic standards, such as the BBC.
