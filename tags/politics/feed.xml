France generates pretty much all of its electricity from nuclear, with reprocessing, using pressurised water reactors. Not only do they have a number of handy engineering benefits such as isolating the water loop through the reactor from the water loop through the turbines, but they also have a particularly useful safety feature in that they&amp;rsquo;re self-regulating &amp;mdash; temperature goes up, power output goes down.</description></item><item><title>Threats to Democracy</title><link>/threats-to-democracy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/threats-to-democracy/</guid><description>After reading about Tom Cruise being banned from filming at certain German military sites because of his belief in Scientology, I was a bit outraged at first, despite my abhorrence of their beliefs, which I think are crazy and nonsensical.
Germany has barred the makers of a movie about a plot to kill Adolf Hitler from filming at German military sites because its star Tom Cruise is a Scientologist, the Defence Ministry said on Monday.</description></item><item><title>Irish Elections and Creative Commons</title><link>/irish-elections-creative-commons/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/irish-elections-creative-commons/</guid><description>This is the text of an email I sent to RTE. In America, CNN Television network is allowing the copying, remixing and free use of presidential debates as long as they are given credit, I believe RTE should follow its lead and extend to other programs:
First of all, sorry this isn&amp;rsquo;t to the right department, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the right one. The technical department which runs the website would make likely be able to deal with and respond to this issue.</description></item><item><title>Best Bush Satire, Ever.</title><link>/best-bush-satire-ever/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/best-bush-satire-ever/</guid><description>This Ladies and Gents, needs no introduction, for you all know George W. &amp;ldquo;Dubya&amp;rdquo; Bush. What you may not know is the Daily Show, which is a popular news satire show in the US.

Fell free to email your opinions to them directly: ** DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov**. As a net citizen, get your voice heard on the most important public debate of our times! Dear Sir/Madam, I, as a citizen of Ireland and the EU, think with respect, the Internet should have a world governing body, fairly appointed by each country who has more than 30% of their respective populations online.</description></item><item><title>Nuclear or Nothing?</title><link>/nuclear-or-nothing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/nuclear-or-nothing/</guid><description>In Ireland we, like the rest of the world, have though questions to answer. Ireland being an island economy, is especially reliant on oil, none of which we produce. I was surprised earlier this week to hear one of George W. Bush’s top aides, saying that the U.S. needs to lose dependence on foreign oil and research alternatives. I was never more shocked, to hear Bush’s change of heart, from using improved technology, to one of his aides saying they need to use less oil.</description></item><item><title>Gallery, Riots and Policy Change</title><link>/gallery-riots-and-policy-change/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gallery-riots-and-policy-change/</guid><description>Well I can’t believe I only had one post in February! A lot has happened since then, with Danish cartoons, Dublin Riots and a few policy changes to the site. First of all the cartoons, I mean, whats all the fuss? Christianity is banned in Saudi Arabia and Muslims in the middle east just don’t get the idea of ‘free press’. No one should be allowed to immigrate to the western world, if they do not hold the core values which we hold, such as human rights, free of expression/press and other values.</description></item><item><title>New Year, Lets Review!</title><link>/new-year-lets-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/new-year-lets-review/</guid><description>Well another year has passed, so I thought I’d make a short recap of it, and tell you what I am looking forward to in 2006. The year was firmly in the hands of mother nature as we saw in both Pakistan, New Orleans/Gulf of Mexico and the Tsunami’s after effects. International consensus was reached at the G8 as London was being bombed - not by the IRA, but by their new enemies in the middle east.</description></item></channel></rss>
