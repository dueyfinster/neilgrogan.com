      <description>&lt;p&gt;If only we had such sense here in Ireland, we can&amp;rsquo;t meet our commitments and it&#xA;will hurt the economy in the long run not to go nuclear. The ESB has said&#xA;&amp;ldquo;sometime in the 2030&amp;rsquo;s we will need to look at it&amp;rdquo; - why not look at it now?&#xA;These projects take 10-15 years at least to implement properly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nuclear Power Debates... why not in Ireland?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some really informative stuff on Slashdot regarding nuclear power:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;http://slashdot.org/~david.given&#34;&gt;david.given (6740)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;France generates pretty much all of its electricity from nuclear, with&#xA;reprocessing, using pressurised water reactors. Not only do they have a number&#xA;of handy engineering benefits such as isolating the water loop through the&#xA;reactor from the water loop through the turbines, but they also have a&#xA;particularly useful safety feature in that they&amp;rsquo;re self-regulating &amp;mdash;&#xA;temperature goes up, power output goes down. France has an excellent safety&#xA;record; I can find only one major incident, which was a coolant spill in 2008.&#xA;They even do their own waste reprocessing into plutonium, which is then reused&#xA;to generate more power. Unaccountably, terrorists don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have stolen&#xA;any of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading about&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://uk.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUKL253889920070625?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;rpc=451&amp;amp;sp=true&#34;&gt;Tom Cruise being banned from filming at certain German military sites because of his belief in Scientology&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;I was a bit outraged at first, despite my abhorrence of their beliefs, which I&#xA;think are crazy and nonsensical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/07/Image:Scientology_warning_leaflet.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../img/07/Scientology_warning_leaflet.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Germany has barred the makers of a movie about a plot to kill Adolf Hitler&#xA;from filming at German military sites because its star Tom Cruise is a&#xA;Scientologist, the Defence Ministry said on Monday. Cruise, also one of the&#xA;film&amp;rsquo;s producers, is a member of the Church of Scientology which the German&#xA;government does not recognise as a church. Berlin says it masquerades as a&#xA;religion to make money, a charge Scientology leaders reject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the text of an email I sent to RTE. In America, CNN Television network&#xA;is allowing the copying, remixing and free use of presidential debates as long&#xA;as they are given credit, I believe RTE should follow its lead and extend to&#xA;other programs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First of all, sorry this isn&amp;rsquo;t to the right department, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the&#xA;right one. The technical department which runs the website would make likely&#xA;be able to deal with and respond to this issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Ladies and Gents, needs no introduction, for you all know George W. &amp;ldquo;Dubya&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bush. What you may not know is the Daily Show, which is a popular news satire&#xA;show in the US. If you have time I recommend you have a look on YouTube for more&#xA;videos&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Law and the Interweb</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing this because, I regret to say, the stupidity of humanity. People&#xA;nowadays define their own law on the Web and the Internet (don’t know the&#xA;difference, you should), while disregarding real life. Maybe its a lack of&#xA;understanding about technology or law, I don’t know. One things for sure, common&#xA;sense can go a long way. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thecommitments.net/&#34; title=&#34;The Commitments Official Website&#34;&gt;Take for example this website on the&#xA;Commitments&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits linking from unauthorised sites! You&#xA;see? I just broke the law right there, amazing dontcha think? The person who&#xA;designed or put the statement up, is a total complete and utter idiot, and I&#xA;don’t care if thats considered slander! Imagine if every site was to do this?&#xA;Search engines would be just another litagation filled business, like so many&#xA;other. With Lawyers reviewing every site to go into the database, Google would&#xA;have a handful, maybe a 100 sites, instead of the usual billions it indexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Letter to U.S. Dept of Commerce, RE: The Future of the Internet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my letter to U.S. Dept. of Commerce, stating what I believe should&#xA;happen to the Internet. Fell free to email your opinions to them directly: **&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov&#34;&gt;DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov&lt;/a&gt;**. As a net citizen, get your voice heard on the&#xA;most important public debate of our times! Dear Sir/Madam, I, as a citizen of&#xA;Ireland and the EU, think with respect, the Internet should have a world&#xA;governing body, fairly appointed by each country who has more than 30% of their&#xA;respective populations online. For those under 30% they should get to have a&#xA;sub-committee, to prioritise and promote the Internet in their countries. I&#xA;think while although ICANN has generally not been a bad governing body, vast&#xA;improvements can be made, such as not allowing pressure from companies to&#xA;increase domain prices, when the cost of providing them has come down&#xA;dramatically over the past few years. I do recognise, that the Internet was&#xA;partially created with the help of U.S. government funding, but this comes from&#xA;the people of America, who would want the Internet to be a force for change,&#xA;like for example, the way it is helping Chinese dissidents.Also, as with all US&#xA;government generated ideas, it is free from patent and copyright which applies&#xA;worldwide, such as NASA images, for example. This should be true of the Internet&#xA;also, as it is with GPS (which I use regularly, Thanks for that!). I am not a&#xA;whole believer in the U.N. however, I think the Internet governing body should&#xA;be free form all Government and International organisational pressures (but not&#xA;those that seek to limit abuse, such as child pornography, obviously). I thank&#xA;you for offering a public debate on this issue and I sincerely hope the outcome&#xA;will be of benefit to everyone living on earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently found a great documentary, about 9/11, entitled Loose Change 9/11][].&#xA;It is easily the most powerful about the event, much more so than Fahrenheit&#xA;9/11. In fact I would even argue, that if this documentary had of aired during&#xA;the U.S. presedential election, I would have bet on a different result. Backed&#xA;up by trusted resources such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm&#34; title=&#34;BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well&#34;&gt;BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19&#xA;highjackers are alive and well&lt;/a&gt;. Filled with outrageous facts, it sets the&#xA;scene for either a highly competent Bush regime that new what it was doing, or&#xA;the worst domestic tragedy that happend under maladministration. Either way the&#xA;American people have serious questions to ask, which I hope in time will get the&#xA;aired in time. Maybe George W. is taking a leaf out of Charlie Haugheys book?&#xA;That is that corruption can be a force for the good of the public, and my rich&#xA;friends?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was surprised earlier this week to hear one of George W. Bush’s top&#xA;aides, saying that the U.S. needs to lose dependence on foreign oil and research&#xA;alternatives. I was never more shocked, to hear Bush’s change of heart, from&#xA;using improved technology, to one of his aides saying they need to use less oil.&#xA;Part of me was angry, as he defiantly rejected Kyoto agreement, when the United&#xA;States produces 25+% of all greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As tech savvy readers will be aware, dot EU is the latest domain to go into&#xA;public use. What is a domain? A domain is the name used for internet site like&#xA;&amp;ldquo;dueyfinster.eu&amp;rdquo;. It has already sold over 1.25 million names already, this&#xA;entering the third day of the public sale. Their have been bitter critics of how&#xA;it has dealt out, with heated arguments over some domains such as Polo.eu, which&#xA;was claimed by no less than 3 entities: Volkswagen, Ralph Lauren and Nestle.&#xA;Volkswagen won out eventually, all because they got their application in first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gallery, Riots and Policy Change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I can’t believe I only had one post in February! A lot has happened since&#xA;then, with Danish cartoons, Dublin Riots and a few policy changes to the site.&#xA;First of all the cartoons, I mean, whats all the fuss? Christianity is banned in&#xA;Saudi Arabia and Muslims in the middle east just don’t get the idea of ‘free&#xA;press’. No one should be allowed to immigrate to the western world, if they do&#xA;not hold the core values which we hold, such as human rights, free of&#xA;expression/press and other values. Should we worry about the middle east? Not at&#xA;all, they’re behind the times, their loss. Why is it that movies which parody&#xA;Christianity are so popular with Christians (like Monty Python)? We have evolved&#xA;and can tolerate jokes and laugh at ourselves, many, but not all Muslims have&#xA;not learned to do this, but they will, its called evolution, and sooner or&#xA;later, it will hit the middle east. I am not defending the Cartoons, and I know&#xA;Muslims do not produce images of Muhammad, and offense to this, I can&#xA;understand. But they need to relax, maybe try some of the many drugs they like&#xA;to export to us?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Year, Lets Review!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well another year has passed, so I thought I’d make a short recap of it, and&#xA;tell you what I am looking forward to in 2006. The year was firmly in the hands&#xA;of mother nature as we saw in both Pakistan, New Orleans/Gulf of Mexico and the&#xA;Tsunami’s after effects. International consensus was reached at the G8 as London&#xA;was being bombed - not by the IRA, but by their new enemies in the middle east.&#xA;Iran esculated its pressure on the world by resuming its nuclear activities.&#xA;George W. Bush took office in January, much to the distaste of the Daily Mirror&#xA;in the UK, who scored their most famous headline, “How Could 59,054,087 People,&#xA;Be So Dumb?”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The British Press annoys me so much, they way they constantly get it wrong&#xA;across the board about the EU. I am a fond supporter of the EU for all its&#xA;faults and cracks. But I love freedom of the press and like organisations who&#xA;uphold basic journalistic standards, such as the BBC. This leads me onto the&#xA;evil man behind it all, Rupert Murdoch owner of The Sun, BSkyB Television, The&#xA;Times and other media outlets. It seems all he pushes is his agenda, whether it&#xA;be the Bush Right-Christian agenda on Fox in the US or Eurosceptic view in his&#xA;British interests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
