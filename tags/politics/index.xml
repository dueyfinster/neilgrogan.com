      <description>&lt;p&gt;If only we had such sense here in Ireland, we can&amp;rsquo;t meet our commitments and it will hurt the economy in the long run not to go nuclear. The ESB has said &amp;ldquo;sometime in the 2030&amp;rsquo;s we will need to look at it&amp;rdquo; - why not look at it now? These projects take 10-15 years at least to implement properly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nuclear Power Debates... why not in Ireland?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some really informative stuff on Slashdot regarding nuclear power:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;http://slashdot.org/~david.given&#34;&gt;david.given (6740)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;France generates pretty much all of its electricity from nuclear,&#xA;with reprocessing, using pressurised water reactors. Not only do they&#xA;have a number of handy engineering benefits such as isolating the&#xA;water loop through the reactor from the water loop through the&#xA;turbines, but they also have a particularly useful safety feature in&#xA;that they&amp;rsquo;re self-regulating &amp;mdash; temperature goes up, power output&#xA;goes down. France has an excellent safety record; I can find only one&#xA;major incident, which was a coolant spill in 2008.&#xA;They even do their own waste reprocessing into plutonium, which is&#xA;then reused to generate more power. Unaccountably, terrorists don&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;seem to have stolen any of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading about &lt;a href=&#34;http://uk.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUKL253889920070625?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;rpc=451&amp;amp;sp=true&#34;&gt;Tom Cruise&#xA;being banned from filming at certain German military sites because of&#xA;his belief in&#xA;Scientology&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;I was a bit outraged at first, despite my abhorrence of their beliefs,&#xA;which I think are crazy and nonsensical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/07/Image:Scientology_warning_leaflet.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../img/07/Scientology_warning_leaflet.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Germany has barred the makers of a movie about a plot to kill Adolf&#xA;Hitler from filming at German military sites because its star Tom&#xA;Cruise is a Scientologist, the Defence Ministry said on Monday.&#xA;Cruise, also one of the film&amp;rsquo;s producers, is a member of the Church of&#xA;Scientology which the German government does not recognise as a&#xA;church. Berlin says it masquerades as a religion to make money, a&#xA;charge Scientology leaders reject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This&#xA;is the text of an email I sent to RTE. In America, CNN Television&#xA;network is allowing the copying, remixing and free use of presidential&#xA;debates as long as they are given credit, I believe RTE should follow&#xA;its lead and extend to other programs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First of all, sorry this isn&amp;rsquo;t to the right department, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;find the right one. The technical department which runs the website&#xA;would make likely be able to deal with and respond to this issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Ladies and Gents, needs no introduction, for you all know George W.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dubya&amp;rdquo; Bush. What you may not know is the Daily Show, which is a popular news&#xA;satire show in the US. If you have time I recommend you have a look on YouTube&#xA;for more videos&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Law and the Interweb</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing this because, I regret to say, the stupidity of humanity. People&#xA;nowadays define their own law on the Web and the Internet (don’t know the&#xA;difference, you should), while disregarding real life. Maybe its a lack of&#xA;understanding about technology or law, I don’t know. One things for sure,&#xA;common sense can go a long way. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thecommitments.net/&#34; title=&#34;The Commitments Official Website&#34;&gt;Take for example this website on the&#xA;Commitments&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits linking from unauthorised sites!&#xA;You see? I just broke the law right there, amazing dontcha think? The person&#xA;who designed or put the statement up, is a total complete and utter idiot, and&#xA;I don’t care if thats considered slander! Imagine if every site was to do&#xA;this? Search engines would be just another litagation filled business, like so&#xA;many other. With Lawyers reviewing every site to go into the database, Google&#xA;would have a handful, maybe a 100 sites, instead of the usual billions it&#xA;indexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Letter to U.S. Dept of Commerce, RE: The Future of the Internet</title>
      <link>/my-letter-to-us-dept-of-commerce-re/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my letter to U.S. Dept. of Commerce, stating what I believe should&#xA;happen to the Internet. Fell free to email your opinions to them directly: **&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov&#34;&gt;DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov&lt;/a&gt;**. As a net citizen, get your voice heard on&#xA;the most important public debate of our times!   Dear Sir/Madam,   I, as a&#xA;citizen of Ireland and the EU, think with respect, the Internet should have a&#xA;world governing body, fairly appointed by each country who has more than 30%&#xA;of their respective populations online. For those under 30% they should get to&#xA;have a sub-committee, to prioritise and promote the Internet in their&#xA;countries. I think while although ICANN has generally not been a bad governing&#xA;body, vast improvements can be made, such as not allowing pressure from&#xA;companies to increase domain prices, when the cost of providing them has come&#xA;down dramatically over the past few years. I do recognise, that the Internet&#xA;was partially created with the help of U.S. government funding, but this comes&#xA;from the people of America, who would want the Internet to be a force for&#xA;change, like for example, the way it is helping Chinese dissidents.Also, as&#xA;with all US government generated ideas, it is free from patent and copyright&#xA;which applies worldwide, such as NASA images, for example. This should be true&#xA;of the Internet also, as it is with GPS (which I use regularly, Thanks for&#xA;that!). I am not a whole believer in the U.N. however, I think the Internet&#xA;governing body should be free form all Government and International&#xA;organisational pressures (but not those that seek to limit abuse, such as&#xA;child pornography, obviously). I thank you for offering a public debate on&#xA;this issue and I sincerely hope the outcome will be of benefit to everyone&#xA;living on earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently found a great documentary, about 9/11, entitled Loose Change&#xA;9/11][]. It is easily the most powerful about the event, much more so than&#xA;Fahrenheit 9/11. In fact I would even argue, that if this documentary had of&#xA;aired during the U.S. presedential election, I would have bet on a different&#xA;result. Backed up by trusted resources such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm&#34; title=&#34;BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well&#34;&gt;BBC which confirmed at&#xA;least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well&lt;/a&gt;. Filled with outrageous&#xA;facts, it sets the scene for either a highly competent Bush regime that new&#xA;what it was doing, or the worst domestic tragedy that happend under&#xA;maladministration. Either way the American people have serious questions to&#xA;ask, which I hope in time will get the aired in time. Maybe George W. is&#xA;taking a leaf out of Charlie Haugheys book? That is that corruption can be a&#xA;force for the good of the public, and my rich friends?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was surprised earlier this week to hear one of George W. Bush’s&#xA;top aides, saying that the U.S. needs to lose dependence on foreign oil and&#xA;research alternatives. I was never more shocked, to hear Bush’s change of&#xA;heart, from using improved technology, to one of his aides saying they need to&#xA;use less oil. Part of me was angry, as he defiantly rejected Kyoto agreement,&#xA;when the United States produces 25+% of all greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As tech savvy readers will be aware, dot EU is the latest domain to go into&#xA;public use. What is a domain? A domain is the name used for internet site like&#xA;&amp;ldquo;dueyfinster.eu&amp;rdquo;. It has already sold over 1.25 million names already, this&#xA;entering the third day of the public sale. Their have been bitter critics of&#xA;how it has dealt out, with heated arguments over some domains such as Polo.eu,&#xA;which was claimed by no less than 3 entities: Volkswagen, Ralph Lauren and&#xA;Nestle. Volkswagen won out eventually, all because they got their application&#xA;in first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gallery, Riots and Policy Change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I can’t believe I only had one post in February! A lot has happened since&#xA;then, with Danish cartoons, Dublin Riots and a few policy changes to the site.&#xA;First of all the cartoons, I mean, whats all the fuss? Christianity is banned&#xA;in Saudi Arabia and Muslims in the middle east just don’t get the idea of&#xA;‘free press’. No one should be allowed to immigrate to the western world, if&#xA;they do not hold the core values which we hold, such as human rights, free of&#xA;expression/press and other values. Should we worry about the middle east? Not&#xA;at all, they’re behind the times, their loss. Why is it that movies which&#xA;parody Christianity are so popular with Christians (like Monty Python)? We&#xA;have evolved and can tolerate jokes and laugh at ourselves, many, but not all&#xA;Muslims have not learned to do this, but they will, its called evolution, and&#xA;sooner or later, it will hit the middle east. I am not defending the Cartoons,&#xA;and I know Muslims do not produce images of Muhammad, and offense to this, I&#xA;can understand. But they need to relax, maybe try some of the many drugs they&#xA;like to export to us?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Year, Lets Review!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well another year has passed, so I thought I’d make a short recap of it, and&#xA;tell you what I am looking forward to in 2006. The year was firmly in the&#xA;hands of mother nature as we saw in both Pakistan, New Orleans/Gulf of Mexico&#xA;and the Tsunami’s after effects. International consensus was reached at the G8&#xA;as London was being bombed - not by the IRA, but by their new enemies in the&#xA;middle east. Iran esculated its pressure on the world by resuming its nuclear&#xA;activities. George W. Bush took office in January, much to the distaste of the&#xA;Daily Mirror in the UK, who scored their most famous headline, “How Could&#xA;59,054,087 People, Be So Dumb?”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The British Press annoys me so much, they way they constantly get it  wrong&#xA;across the board about the EU. I am a fond supporter of the EU  for all its&#xA;faults and cracks. But I love freedom of the press and  like organisations who&#xA;uphold basic journalistic standards, such as  the BBC. This leads me onto the&#xA;evil man behind it all, Rupert Murdoch owner of The Sun, BSkyB Television, The&#xA;Times and other media outlets. It seems all he pushes is his agenda, whether&#xA;it be the Bush Right-Christian agenda on Fox in the US or Eurosceptic view in&#xA;his British interests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
