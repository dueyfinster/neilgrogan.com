                <p>As part of my masters degree in University College Dublin, we undertook a group project which focused on building a technology product. I&rsquo;m very proud about how we ran the project, so I&rsquo;d like to give an overview of it here! The product is a technology news application, which personalised your news feed based on your interests. I like to think of it as Facebook meets Techmeme meets your favourite RSS news feeds!</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve recently decided to further my education by applying for a Masters in Computer Science at University College Dublin. It&rsquo;s very different from a traditional masters course in that it is very much focused on industry, the term the University uses is &ldquo;Negotiated Learning&rdquo;. It was a colleague of mine that introduced me to it, I was not even aware that there was what I would call &lsquo;non-strict masters&rsquo; (that is not a set-in-stone syllabus/research direction).</p>

                <p>It has been a whirlwind four years, but this day marks the cessation of my full-time education for my honours degree. It is an overwhelming feeling of relief, joy, sadness and all of the emotions you feel when leaving an institution that has been a huge part of my life, if only for four short years.
  The best part of my course has been without doubt, the friends for life I have made.</p>

I am an avid iPhone user and I have bought Android phones also, they are great devices I can&rsquo;t imagine not having now that they are here. As part of my thesis I touched on the old way to develop apps, using Symbian C++ or J2ME and we&rsquo;ve come a long, long way since then.</p>

We used Python, Google App Engine and a lot of Javascript to create a modern, sleek Customer Relationship Management system. All the code is open source, under GPLv3.</p>

Update: Also noticed Mark has a nice post on it also</p>

                <p>One of our projects this semester is to make a Bauhaus Chess set in a program called 3DS Max (created by Autodesk). 3DS Max is a modeling and animation tool built specifically for creating 3D representations and models. Being a lover of Open Source, when we we’re told although Blender was considered, it fell a bit short for some reason, so we had to use 3DS Max.
3DS Max is not bad to use, some of the tools are nice if your not an arty type (like me) and prefer more technical and structured things.</p>

 Learn C in XCode on a Mac Make an awesome CRM program for College degree (Python, Google App Engine) Learn Vim and Emacs bindings, using them for code Learn to use Git, possibly mercurial Learn some Obj-C with Cocoa Learn some C++ with Qt Learn Python +Tcl/tk Learn more about the design of Linux kernel and study some of it&rsquo;s code Do Sysadmin stuff on my server on Linode; like setting upSendmail,IRCServers and other stuff If I have time, investigate CakePHP, Django, maybe Ruby (on Rails?</p>

                <p>Just a quick post on Google Sketch UP for Mac (also available for Windows), it is a very nice application. I drew my Engineering project (Leaving Certificate) on it, to see if it was easy enough for a novice (Read: Me) to mess around and get something functional out of it. Most people have heard of Computer Aided Design, but usually the applications are expensive to say the least. Not so with Google Sketchup, it is totally free and can import some of the most popular 3D drawing formats.</p>
