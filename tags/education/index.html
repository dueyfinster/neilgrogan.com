built specifically for creating 3D representations and models. Being a lover of
Open Source, when we we’re told although Blender was considered, it fell a bit
short for some reason, so we had to use 3DS Max.</p>
<p>3DS Max is not bad to use, some of the tools are nice if your not an arty type
(like me) and prefer more technical and structured things. Some of the effects
(like glass and water) give a really nice effect to add to the model your
designing. Also as part of the project we had to have an accompanying website,
which you can view at <a href="http://bark4mark.com/bauhaus">bark4mark.com/bauhaus</a></p></p>

<p>That should keep me busy besides college and working! I didn&rsquo;t include any
security stuff, as we&rsquo;re doing best practice for my honours degree next year. If
anyone has any of their own, I&rsquo;d love to see, or any resources to help me
complete my list ^-^ Happy 2010!</p></p>

a quick post on Google Sketch UP for Mac (also available for Windows), it is a
very nice application. I drew my Engineering project (Leaving Certificate) on
it, to see if it was easy enough for a novice (Read: Me) to mess around and get
something functional out of it. Most people have heard of Computer Aided Design,
but usually the applications are expensive to say the least. Not so with Google
Sketchup, it is totally free and can import some of the most popular 3D drawing
formats. It is easy to use, but difficult to master is how I would best describe
this product. The video tutorials Google provides on their website is a huge
help, and got me off to a good start. They represented what every tutorial
should be: short, snappy and to the point. The User Interface should be designed
a little better and be a little clearer, but for a free product, it does exactly
what it says on the tin. So I got down to business, and I present my very first
drawing in Google

                <p><p>I have ordered and I am expecting delivery of my brand new Apple MacBook (or
BlackBook as some call it)! It will be a Black, 2Ghz Core Duo, 1 GB RAM, 120 GB
HDD (5400 RPM) MacBook, complete with a remote, Bluetooth 2 and Wifi
functionality. Not mention cool applications such as iSight built in Camera,
Front Row ( a media center) and Spotlight search technology. It cost me close to
€2.000, so hopefully it will be worth it ;-)</p></p>
