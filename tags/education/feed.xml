I&amp;rsquo;m very proud about how we ran the project, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to give an overview of it here! The product is a technology news application, which personalised your news feed based on your interests. I like to think of it as Facebook meets Techmeme meets your favourite RSS news feeds!</description></item><item><title>MSc in Computer Science at UCD</title><link>/ucd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ucd/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently decided to further my education by applying for a Masters in Computer Science at University College Dublin. It&amp;rsquo;s very different from a traditional masters course in that it is very much focused on industry, the term the University uses is &amp;ldquo;Negotiated Learning&amp;quot;. It was a colleague of mine that introduced me to it, I was not even aware that there was what I would call &amp;lsquo;non-strict masters&amp;rsquo; (that is not a set-in-stone syllabus/research direction).</description></item><item><title>Final Year of Honours Degree, Complete</title><link>/final-year-of-honours-degree-complete/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/final-year-of-honours-degree-complete/</guid><description>It has been a whirlwind four years, but this day marks the cessation of my full-time education for my honours degree. It is an overwhelming feeling of relief, joy, sadness and all of the emotions you feel when leaving an institution that has been a huge part of my life, if only for four short years.
The best part of my course has been without doubt, the friends for life I have made.</description></item><item><title>BSc in Computing</title><link>/bsc-in-computing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bsc-in-computing/</guid><description>Wow&amp;hellip; what a weird feeling, I have a degree under my belt. Three years, many friends and a lot of hard work later! The degree itself was based on my father&amp;rsquo;s business Grogan Burner Services, and trying to solve a real world problem of using Excel spreadsheets. We used Python, Google App Engine and a lot of Javascript to create a modern, sleek Customer Relationship Management system. All the code is open source, under GPLv3.</description></item><item><title>A Bit of Bau</title><link>/bit-of-bau/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bit-of-bau/</guid><description>This is a 3rd Graphics project we presented as a group for Computer Science. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank Mark and James, my team members, for all their hard work! The subject of Bauhaus was previously discussed in my graphical representation of a 3D chess set. The music is courtesy of Jamendo, and is free ;) Enjoy it the video!
Update: Also noticed Mark has a nice post on it also</description></item><item><title>Computer Graphics: Bauhaus Chess Design</title><link>/computer-graphics-bauhaus-chess-design/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/computer-graphics-bauhaus-chess-design/</guid><description>One of our projects this semester is to make a Bauhaus Chess set in a program called 3DS Max (created by Autodesk). 3DS Max is a modeling and animation tool built specifically for creating 3D representations and models. Being a lover of Open Source, when we weâ€™re told although Blender was considered, it fell a bit short for some reason, so we had to use 3DS Max.
3DS Max is not bad to use, some of the tools are nice if your not an arty type (like me) and prefer more technical and structured things.</description></item><item><title>Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown</title><link>/institute-of-technology-blanchardstown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/institute-of-technology-blanchardstown/</guid><description>I have got a place in a 4 year Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computing, or more commonly known as Computer Science (or comp sci as I am lazy and like to abbreviate). This means I might be blogging slightly less sometimes, but it should be a hell of a lot more interesting and I promise to keep my posts not too technical as I have up to this point.</description></item><item><title>Engineering Drawing</title><link>/engineering-drawing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/engineering-drawing/</guid><description>Just a quick post on Google Sketch UP for Mac (also available for Windows), it is a very nice application. I drew my Engineering project (Leaving Certificate) on it, to see if it was easy enough for a novice (Read: Me) to mess around and get something functional out of it. Most people have heard of Computer Aided Design, but usually the applications are expensive to say the least. Not so with Google Sketchup, it is totally free and can import some of the most popular 3D drawing formats.</description></item></channel></rss>
