This book is really a case study in why the future of work will be remote, of which the book did convince me (but I would say, I already believed).
The book is really structured to convince those who do not believe in the premise of the title.</description></item><item><title>Review of the Official Ubuntu Book, Second Edition (2007)</title><link>https://www.neilgrogan.com/review-of-official-ubuntu-book-second/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.neilgrogan.com/review-of-official-ubuntu-book-second/</guid><description>The Ubuntu Book (2nd Edition) is a nicely put together book for dealing with the Linux operating system in a number of clearly laid out and well presented chapters. Chapters are as follows:
Introducing Ubuntu Installing Ubuntu Using Ubuntu on the Desktop Advanced Usage and Managing Ubuntu Ubuntu Server Support / Typical Problems Using Kubuntu Ubuntu Community Ubuntu-Related Projects Using Edubuntu This book is a very complete introduction and contains suprising elements related to finding out and joining the community of users - which you will not find in other Ubuntu Books (such as O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Ubuntu Hacks) which make it a unique and worthwhile addition to any Ubuntu users personal library.</description></item></channel></rss>
