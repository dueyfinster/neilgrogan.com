It&rsquo;s interesting the different approach each company is taking.
Chrome ad:
To me the Chrome ad is very family oriented, stressing the utility of the web and the ease of reaching people and staying in touch. No surprise they didn&rsquo;t feature Facebook, which is what the vast majority use to keep in touch.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 30, 2012</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../microsoft-settles-with-eolas-over/>Microsoft settles with Eolas over Internet Explorer</a></h2><div><p>Microsoft has settled with Eolas over a number of patents regarding browser plugins which chicago based Eolas filed patents for in 1998. A jury in Chicago then found Microsoft guilty of infringing on Eolas’ patents and was told to pay $521m US Dollars in &lsquo;damages&rsquo;. That ruling was overturned and a fresh trial ordered which was due to start very soon, but it seems Microsoft has decided to pay out:</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 31, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../dell-refunds-me-for-windows/>Dell refunds me for Windows!</a></h2><div><p>As many of you know I am a Linux and Mac aficionado. For my Linux machines, all of them are Dell. I have been always pleased with Dells prices, how their machines work with Linux, their customer service and the fact they are made in Limerick, Ireland (I am from Ireland). I politely emailed Dell (well got up on my high horse), heres my first mail:
I would like a refund of Windows XP since I am installing Ubuntu Linux on the computer when I get it.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 21, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../seven-financial-reasons-not-to-use/>Seven financial reasons not to use Windows</a></h2><div><p>I recently read a very insightful article on 7 factors every company should seriously consider about Microsoft Windows, here they are summarised:
Licensing Costs Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating systems and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of money on licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S. companies overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software maintenance in 2007.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 6, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../bill-gates-lists-vista/>Bill Gates lists Vista 'innovations'</a></h2><div><p>Hard to believe really, Mr.Gates lists Windows Vista &lsquo;innovations&rsquo;. Now Apple has been shipping everything he mentions since 2005, and I have tried Vista, it doesn&rsquo;t even surpass Apples&rsquo; attempt at the software (which should be his aim). Some things have been around for years, but it&rsquo;s how well your software can do it is the key. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t tout features that another competitor does better, but thats just me.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 29, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../get-facts-about-get-facts/>Get the facts, about "Get the Facts"</a></h2><div><p>Just a quick blurb about some things Microsoft like to say: Don&rsquo;t believe it, well at least not it all anyway. On the Irish &ldquo;Get the Facts&rdquo; page (on Windows Server vs. Linux), they make critical errors of judgement a person reasonably well versed in computing could deconstruct. First of all, Linux isn&rsquo;t a server, its a kernel, like the Windows kernel. So comparing &ldquo;Windows Server 2003&rdquo; to &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; is misleading to say the least, and stupid to say the most.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 21, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../internet-explorer-thanks-firefox/>Internet Explorer thanks Firefox, sincerely?</a></h2><div><p>Reading my favourite tech news site: Slashdot ( /.), I see the Internet Explorer team have sent the Firefox Team a nice cake:
One comment I read said it all really:
Seems even the IE team knows that IE is dead.
As for the ex-lax, bugs, pubes in the cake of course none of that is true. Those things would only be possible if someone at Microsoft actually made the cake, and that&rsquo;s not how MS does things.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 26, 2006</time></div></article></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=../../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
