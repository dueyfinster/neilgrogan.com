<p>To me the Chrome ad is very family oriented, stressing the utility of the web and the ease of reaching people and staying in touch. No surprise they didn&rsquo;t feature Facebook, which is what the vast majority use to keep in touch.<br /></p></p>

Eolas</a>
over a number of patents regarding browser plugins which chicago based
Eolas filed patents for in 1998. A jury in Chicago then found Microsoft
guilty of infringing on Eolas’ patents and was told to pay $521m US
Dollars in &lsquo;damages&rsquo;. That ruling was overturned and a fresh trial
ordered which was due to start very soon, but it seems Microsoft has
decided to pay out:</p></p>

I have been always pleased with Dells prices, how their machines work

Limerick, Ireland (I am from Ireland). I politely emailed Dell (well got
up on my high horse), heres my first mail:</p>

<p>I would like a refund of Windows XP since I am installing Ubuntu Linux
on the computer when I get it. When I turn on the computer I am going
to decline the EULA, and I am within my rights to request this refund
(as part of Irish consumer laws). This also applies in Britian, see

I recently read a very insightful article on 7 factors every company
should seriously consider about Microsoft Windows, here they are
summarised:</p>
<ol>
<li>Licensing Costs</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating
systems and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of
money on licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S.
companies overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software
maintenance in 2007.</p></p>

                <p><p>Hard to believe really, Mr.Gates lists Windows Vista &lsquo;innovations&rsquo;. Now
Apple has been shipping everything he mentions since 2005, and I have
tried Vista, it doesn&rsquo;t even surpass Apples&rsquo; attempt at the software
(which should be his aim). Some things have been around for years, but
it&rsquo;s how well your software can do it is the key. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t
tout features that another competitor does better, but thats just me. It
seems irresponsible and unbelieveable the head of a public company can
say and get away with this - not knowing the competition that is. I
wouldn&rsquo;t trust my money to anyone who does not keep up with the latest
and greatest trends in the industry.</p></p>

blurb about some things Microsoft like to say: Don&rsquo;t believe it, well at
least not it all anyway. On the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ireland/getthefacts/default.mspx" title="Irish Get the Facts">Irish &ldquo;Get the Facts&rdquo;

(on Windows Server vs. Linux), they make critical errors of judgement a
person reasonably well versed in computing could deconstruct. First of
all, Linux isn&rsquo;t a server, its a kernel, like the Windows kernel. So
comparing &ldquo;Windows Server 2003&rdquo; to &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; is misleading to say the
least, and stupid to say the most. You could run any server software on
Linux you wished, even Windows Server 2003 if Microsoft ported it! For
the sake of argument, I think they are comparing themselves to Apache,
which runs 60% of worldwide
servers<a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/01/05/january_2007_web_server_survey.html" title="Netcraft Server Marketshare">[1]</a>.</p></p>

<p>Seems even the IE team knows that IE is dead.</p>
<p>As for the ex-lax, bugs, pubes in the cake of course none of that is
true. Those things would only be possible if someone at Microsoft
actually made the cake, and that&rsquo;s not how MS does things. They knew
they couldn&rsquo;t make a good cake so they just went out and bought a cake
from someone who already knew how to make one and then stuck their
logo on it and called it theirs.</p></p>
