            <div>
                <p><p>I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Remote-Required-David-Heinemeier-Hansson/dp/0091954673">Remote: Office Not Required</a> by David Heinemeier-Hansson
(who created Ruby on Rails) and Jason Fried (who co-founded 37 Signals with
Heinemeier-Hansson). This book is really a case study in why the future of work
will be remote, of which the book did convince me (but I would say, I already
believed).</p>
<p><img src="../../img/16/remote-book.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The book is really structured to convince those who do not believe in the
premise of the title. It talks about many successful companies who have
transformed themselves to work remotely fully and large corporations who save
lots of money on office space (IBM, being one example).</p></p>

                <p><p>I recently read O&rsquo;Reilly
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Mantainable-Software-Guidelines-Future-Proof/dp/1491953527/">Building Maintainable Software</a>
(Java Edition). It provides good insight as to what to look for to create
maintainability in enterpise software systems.</p>
<h2 id="10-suggestions-the-book-provides">10 suggestions the book provides:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write shorter units</li>
<li>Write simpler units (measured in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">Cyclomatic Complexity</a>)</li>
<li>Write code once only</li>
<li>Keep interfaces very small</li>
<li>Seperate code in to modules</li>
<li>Couple modules loosely</li>
<li>Keep modules evenly sized</li>
<li>Keep codebase small (and look for ways to right-size)</li>
<li>Automate development pipeline and your tests</li>
<li>Write clean code and refactor as you go</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall I thought the book was very well laid out, easy to read and easy to
understand. I&rsquo;d recommend it to anyone new to software development, but most of
the tips contained within the book should be very familiar to the seasoned
developer.</p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>I recently finished reading Steve Jobs, the biography by Walter Isaacson. I
can&rsquo;t add much more then the extensive coverage that it has recieved in the
press to date. Instead I paraphrase really badly a friend of mine, Noel Hudson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that book thought me was dropping acid and treating people really badly
works as a life strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While that&rsquo;s not entirely true it is a humourous look at the books tone. It has
a grain of truth, Walter Issacson really focuses on the warts and all
representation of Steve Jobs. He defines him very much in terms of how other
people percieved him, whether that should have been the mainstay of the book is
up for debate. Overall it&rsquo;s a good book, what I liked most is the history
lessons of the creation of the mac and how the Disney/Pixar relationship went
down before the merger. I also felt Walter Issacson left it hanging at the end
and that he knows much more that he can&rsquo;t publish due to Apple&rsquo;s corporate
strategy being tied to Jobs so much (like the comment he made about cracking the
UI for a TV).</p></p>

Ubuntu Book (2nd Edition) is a nicely put together book for dealing with the
Linux operating system in a number of clearly laid out and well presented
chapters. Chapters are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introducing Ubuntu</li>
<li>Installing Ubuntu</li>
<li>Using Ubuntu on the Desktop</li>
<li>Advanced Usage and Managing Ubuntu</li>
<li>Ubuntu Server</li>
<li>Support / Typical Problems</li>
<li>Using Kubuntu</li>
<li>Ubuntu Community</li>
<li>Ubuntu-Related Projects</li>
<li>Using Edubuntu</li>
</ol>
<p>This book is a very complete introduction and contains suprising elements
related to finding out and joining the community of users - which you will not
find in other Ubuntu Books (such as O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Ubuntu Hacks) which make it a
unique and worthwhile addition to any Ubuntu users personal library. It is most
helpful to new users to Ubuntu, which sections on installing and help with
problems that could be faced. Having said that, it falls short on the amount of
truly unique information that it contains - most of the books contents can be
found on the web. What you are paying for is a well-laid out, well written
account of the Ubuntu-sphere and all that goes along with it.</p></p>
