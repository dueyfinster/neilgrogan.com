Between those and Youtube, I&amp;rsquo;ve watched an awful lot of technology how-to videos and 90% of them are quite poor in terms of editing, sound and being coherent/properly scripted. Sometimes though it&amp;rsquo;s a joy to genuinely learn something new in a short, concise and to the point video.
This haktip is right up there with being among the best: short, concise, to the point and about a utility that will be super-useful to me.</description></item></channel></rss>
