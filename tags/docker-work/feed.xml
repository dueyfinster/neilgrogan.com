It&amp;rsquo;s one of those technologies where when you start to use it, you immediately know it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a sea change in how things are done in the industry. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely going to be more impactful then Virtual Machines.
We&amp;rsquo;ve used Docker to great effect where I work. We&amp;rsquo;re building a huge system called Ericsson Network Manager, which will manage the networks of the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
