So far I am really glad I did, the computer comes with me everywhere. I bring it to work, to visit family, on trips and everywhere in between.
It&rsquo;s the ultimate work computer in many ways, always with you, light enough and comfortable enough for real work™. The keyboard shortcuts in iOS have improved massively from iOS 8 to iOS 9 to the point of actually being useful and the split screen view is actually rather nice to use (I never &ldquo;got&rdquo; it on a Mac).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 13, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../services/>Services I pay for</a></h2><div><p>In alphabetical order:
Amazon.com / Amazon.co.uk - usually buy electronics here! Apple&rsquo;s App Store - I use iOS & Mac heavily, buy a lot of apps! Dropbox - sync files across computers Evernote - I store a lot of notes here. Fastmail - My email, contacts, calendars Hover - great place for domain names (like this one). Lastpass - excellent password manager Newsblur - Personalized RSS for news junkies Pinboard - stores all my bookmarks (also archives the sites) Trello - I&rsquo;m planning a holiday via Trello Some of these are referral links, I stand to get extra credit on these services if you use it.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 26, 2015</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../watch-stand/>Apple Watch Stand</a></h2><div><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e1DiEegB_c

It&rsquo;s hosted on my home broadband connection, but it&rsquo;s just really for small time side-projects like this site. Also it&rsquo;s a way to play around with Docker, VirtualBox, Node.js and all those other fun technologies I don&rsquo;t get time for.

A lot of the talk on tech sites was reminiscent of the famous CMDR Taco (of Slashdot) line: &ldquo;Less space then a nomad. Lame.&rdquo;
I happened to own a Nomad shortly after that famous quote was made. So we can see, quoting Steve Jobs &ldquo;[They] have no taste&rdquo; is applicable to me! I just don&rsquo;t get the watch yet.

I have obviously been so quick to review this device, the iPhone 5 is upon us! My philosophy for reviewing items is you have to live with them. Well boy have I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do marvel at how good the hardware is. I&rsquo;ve dropped this extremely expensive device on occasions too numerous to count, so luckily it is designed well.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 18, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../ipad-evolution/>iPad Evolution?</a></h2><div><p>Since Apple released an iPad there have been various competitors announced, so it got me thinking what would it take for me to buy one? I haven&rsquo;t bought the first generation iPad because the lack of a camera on a device so obviously good for fullscreen video calls has baffled me. I guess they have to store up some ideas since they need a new hardware iteration every year, Apple&rsquo;s revenue model depends on that vital hardware refresh cycle.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 26, 2010</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../haiku-open-source-beos-clone/>Haiku: Open Source BeOS clone</a></h2><div><p>I usually listen to podcasts on the excellent Twit.tv network and it goes without saying Floss Weekly is one of my favourites. A recent episode covered Haiku - an open source operating system based on the design of the old BeOS. What&rsquo;s very interesting about BeOS is the design, an integrated all in one operating system - and the fact Apple almost purchased it. That&rsquo;s amazing to me, literally in one fell swoop, if Apple had of offered the 200 million Be Systems wanted, there would be no NextStep into Apple and by extension - Steve Jobs.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 6, 2010</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../is-mac-pro-overpriced/>Is a Mac Pro overpriced?</a></h2><div><p>Gizmodo seem to think so:
The $2,500 Mac Pro, desperately in need of a refresh, gives you a 2.66GHz Quad-Core Xeon (essentially an i7), 3GB of RAM (triple channel, but seriously?), 640GB hard drive (again, seriously?) and a nominal graphics card. Spend $800 more and you&rsquo;ll get a another processor and 3GB more RAM.
The $2200, 27-inch iMac obviously includes a screen, plus you get a 2.8GHz Quad-Core (i7), 1TB drive, 4GB of RAM and a nominal graphics card.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 24, 2009</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../3g-coverage-in-ireland/>3G Coverage in Ireland</a></h2><div><p>I recently used Twitter to post about my journey on public transport from Kilkenny to Dublin. For people outside of Ireland the total Journey distance was about 90 miles.
I used only my iPhone on the O2 network and close to 50% of the time it seemed like I had 3G. This was on a train moving at speed, and YouTube played very well with little to no stutter. It did drop to Edge the other half of the time, with about 30% of time I still got speeds web browsing was acceptable on.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 20, 2009</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../iphone-3g-review/>iPhone 3G Review</a></h2><div><p>I recently got an iPhone 3G and away from all that Apple mania; I thought I would give an honest review. This is framed in the mindset of all the past Nokia devices (which I have posted about here also) which I have owned.
Okay so where to start? Well I think a good place would be what I could have bought instead. Strange place for a review; but its good to see what is out there and what I was looking at beforehand.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 9, 2009</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../apple-mac-os-x-most-popular-desktop/>Apple Mac OS X: the most popular Desktop Unix?</a></h2><div><p>Apple does it again: explosive growth in the computer market, no doubt in part to its Macbook/Macbook Pro line of laptops. As Ars Technica points out:
As predicted last quarter, however, Apple broke its tie for third place with Gateway by shipping 1.33 million units and growing by a whopping 37.2 percent (double that of any other US vendor) from third quarter 2006 to claim 8.1 percent of the US market for the quarter.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 21, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../apple-play-nice/>Apple - Play Nice....</a></h2><div><p>Is the much beloved Apple the new Microsoft? First there was IBM, the big all crushing corporate machine that was humbled by the next big giant in the form of Microsoft, so it seems Apple&rsquo;s turn is long overdue. The next few weeks are crucial to this crossroads in which Apple finds itself: It owes a HUGE amount to the BSD (an open source Unix clone) which is the foundation for not just OS X, but the iPhone and now the iPod Touch.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 15, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../leopard-worth-wait/>Leopard - Worth the wait?</a></h2><div><p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard of Apple&rsquo;s latest Operating system, have a look at Wikipedia Article on Mac OS X Leopard.

While OpenWengo is open source, and it is SIP, they are not helpful in informing you how to use other clients, or dial other OpenWengo users from other networks.
What I am really talking about is the need for an all-in-one communications program, that is multi-platform.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 13, 2006</time></div></article></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><script src=../../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
