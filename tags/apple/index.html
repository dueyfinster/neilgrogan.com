<p>It&rsquo;s the ultimate work computer in many ways, always with you, light enough and comfortable enough for real work™. The keyboard shortcuts in iOS have improved massively from iOS 8 to iOS 9 to the point of actually being useful and the split screen view is actually rather nice to use (I never &ldquo;got&rdquo; it on a Mac).</p></p>

                <p><p>Interesting announcements yesterday by Apple, finally releasing an iWatch. A lot of the talk on tech sites was reminiscent of the famous CMDR Taco (of Slashdot) line: &ldquo;Less space then a nomad. Lame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I happened to own a Nomad shortly after that famous quote was made. So we can see, quoting Steve Jobs &ldquo;[They] have no taste&rdquo; is applicable to me! I just don&rsquo;t get the watch yet. As a permanent contact wearer, I&rsquo;m waiting for Google Glass in a contact lens! What I do predict however is: motor accidents due to Apple Watch updates and laws banning staring at the thing.</p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>I recently read an article that posed the question &ldquo;<a href="http://nerdgap.com/does-your-dock-reflect-your-priorities/">Does your dock reflect your priorities?</a>&rdquo; - which is an interesting question. Further breaking that idea down leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>What apps do I need the most?</li>
<li>What apps should be next (or be higher priority)?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iphone-dock">iPhone dock</h3>
<img src="../../files/2012/07/iphone.png" alt="iPhone homescreen" />
<ul>
<li><em>Phone app</em>: pretty self explanatory</li>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Still the best mobile browser I think (though if Google ever gets going on a proper Chrome browser for Android that may change)</li>
<li><em>Tweetbot</em>: I like Twitter the most of the social networks and tweetbot is the Swiss army knife if twitter clients</li>
<li><em>Music</em> (aka. iPod app) : I use my iPhone in my car and sometimes at work to listen to music</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ipad-dock">iPad dock</h3>
<img src="../../files/2012/07/ipad.png" alt="iPhone homescreen" />
<ul>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Safari on iPad is not as good as the iPhone version - it can be more full featured I think!</li>
<li><em>Mail app</em>: E-mail on the iPad is one of the most popular uses, it&rsquo;s got just the right amount of screen real-estate to do it justice</li>
<li><em>Photography folder</em>: I don&rsquo;t know why I mistook myself as being interested in photography, but here&rsquo;s a folder I almost never use (bar camera app)</li>
<li><em>Music</em>: I like it uses the screen real-estate better then the iPhone version and it&rsquo;s much nicer to browse music on</li>
<li><em>Tweetbot</em>: Tweetbot for iPad is the best Twitter client for iPad hands down (on the iPhone it&rsquo;s more contested) and sync with Tweetmarker makes it much easier moving between iPhone and iPad versions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve learned I make pretty bad use of the dock on both devices. <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> or <a href="http://www.lastpass.com">Lastpass</a> should probably be in the dock on either device - probably with a feed reader as a close run after that (Reeder or Mr. Reader). These apps feature on either home screen as you can see from the screenshots above. Food for thought I guess!</p></p>

I have obviously been so quick to review this device,  the iPhone 5
is upon us! My philosophy for reviewing items is you <strong>have to live with them</strong>.
Well boy have I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do
marvel at how good the hardware is. I&rsquo;ve dropped this extremely expensive
device on occasions <i>too numerous to count</i>, so luckily it is designed well.</p></p>

announced, so it got me thinking what would it take for me to buy one? I
haven&rsquo;t bought the first generation iPad because the lack of a camera on
a device so obviously good for fullscreen video calls has baffled me. I
guess they have to store up some ideas since they need a new hardware
iteration every year, Apple&rsquo;s revenue model depends on that vital
hardware refresh cycle.</p></p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS">BeOS</a> is the design, an integrated
all in one operating system - and the fact Apple almost purchased it.
That&rsquo;s amazing to me, literally in one fell swoop, if Apple had of
offered the 200 million Be Systems wanted, there would be no NextStep

Apple just surpassed Microsoft to become the second most valuable

                <p><p>I recently used Twitter to
post about my journey on public transport from Kilkenny to Dublin. For
people outside of Ireland the total Journey distance was about 90
miles.</p>
<p>I used only my iPhone on the O2 network and close to 50% of the time it
seemed like I had 3G. This was on a train moving at speed, and YouTube
played very well with little to no stutter. It did drop to Edge the
other half of the time, with about 30% of time I still got speeds web
browsing was acceptable on. So in summary: 80% of the time it was
possible to surf the web.</p></p>

Is the much beloved Apple the new Microsoft? First there was IBM, the
big all crushing corporate machine that was humbled by the next big
giant in the form of Microsoft, so it seems Apple&rsquo;s turn is long
overdue. The next few weeks are crucial to this crossroads in which
Apple finds itself: It owes a HUGE amount to the BSD (an open source
Unix clone) which is the foundation for not just OS X, but the iPhone
and now the iPod Touch. Basically without the kernel that runs these
fantastic devices, Apple would still be up shit creek without a paddle.
Granted the iPod would have been a huge success probably still, but OS
X&rsquo;s core is the foundation for the real money making Apple will do over
the next few years, a point that is not lost on Mr. Jobs as the company
intelligently markets different segments to different markets of which I
have first hand experience of: Go to the Apple site for education and
they extol the brilliance of a Macbook and make they deal sweeter by
throwing in an iPod Nano. But if you go to a link I was provided in a
college advert; they bring to a page pointing out key areas a mac can
make a difference. I picked Computer Science naturally, and the site
extolled the virtues of Open Source, a Unix base and programming tools
like Xcode.</p></p>

<p>While some seem to be not impressed by Leopard, it is by all accounts an
OS upgrade, with every major application recieving attention. To me I am
overjoyed the finder is getting a revamp, though I am not certain
following iTunes layout is such a good idea. I think this is Steve Jobs
(CEO. Apple Inc) idea to &ldquo;switch&rdquo; windows people since they already use
iTunes, although I am not sure it is the right path. I choose Mac OS X
because its unique, it has a fresh take on how a user interacts with a
computer, moreso than Linux (which adopts tried and true in the case of
Gnome and KDE), and certainly Windows which has only tweaked the look
since Windows 95: its the same concept. The fanning out of dock icons,
and grouping them won&rsquo;t be used by the vast majority of users: its the
same reason they don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;smart&rdquo; folders: its a feature that has
little in the way of wide appeal. I know the same can be said of the
dashboard, and I personally will most likely end up buying and using
fanning out and collections in Leopard, but my experience of novices is
that they are afraid of the unknown.</p></p>

to the details of the video. I use Garageband for audio, iMovieHD to
edit the video and audio and Copernicus to record my screen. I started
by getting everything I needed ready (all the Firefox tabs etc.) and hit
record in Copernicus. I imported that .mov into iMovieHD, and then
proceeded to open Garageband, watch the video and talk myself through my
own recording. I saved the voice part in Garageband, exported it and
then imported it into iMovie. I checked to make sure the audio and video
lined up perefectly (what I done on screen matched what I was saying)
and then exported it as a .mov from iMovieHD. Then I uploaded the result
to Youtube, which I think for a first try ain&rsquo;t bad!! Watch it here:</p></p>

<p>Well I guess you can call me a hardcore <a href="http://www.apple.ie" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> fan, I have a Macbook, an iPod Nano (1st Gen 4GB) and now a
80GB iPod Video! I bought i for a couple of reasons, namely price and storage.
I had been put off before since I thought they were too bulky ( I know a
couple of people who have older generation iPod Videos) after being with the
Nano for over a year (its still chugging along gleefully). What can I say? I
am impressed! Battery life is huge to me and well to be frank, its amazing. My
first MP3 player was a Creative Nomad Jukebox II (circa 2002), which I still
have. I know only one person who owned an MP3 player before me, and its nice
to be there from the start, you appreciate the little details most people
don´t, as they are new to mp3 players, so they expect it as standard. I now
get all the latest tech podcasts, so I am very happy with that!</p></p>

                <p><p>Turns out my prediction wasn&rsquo;t quite correct, it was not the Power Management
Unit (<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319">PMU</a>), it was the heatsink. <a href="http://www.mactivate.ie/">Mactivate</a> have informed me they have
one on order from <a href="http://www.apple.ie/">Apple</a>, so it will take a bit longer than I anticipated
to get my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">Macbook</a> back. I found this strange as I had not experienced
random shutdowns like the ones that have been widely reported across the web.
it was like I described in my earlier post, something to do with the battery
not being able to charge. Then again, I am no expert on this and their is wide
evidence (over 1600 people have identified heatsink as a problem in their
Macbooks) that the heatsink is a definite issue. Sounds like good or bad I
will have a lot more to say about Apple Computer in the future, thats why I
have decided to add them as a category.</p></p>

                <p><p>Well first of all, there has been some blog updates, inspired no less by my
Grandfather! He&rsquo;s at a fragile old age, so he can&rsquo;t read the screen all too
well. This is not a problem however, as he sets all fonts to 16 and higher in
<a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> (which is out of beta and into version 2.0!). That got me
thinking, as I really struggled to read this page being marginally away from
the screen, as I am a [Keratoconus][] sufferer. As a result, I have enlarged
all fonts in my blog, in an effort to make them more readable&hellip; I encourage
everyone to do the same, or at least follow the [web standards][] so that it
can be properly auto resized by browsers.</p></p>

functionality. Not mention cool applications such as iSight built in Camera,
Front Row ( a media center) and Spotlight search technology. It cost me close
to €2.000, so hopefully it will be worth it ;-)</p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>I feel I need to confess why I am buying a <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macbook/macbook.html" title="MacBook">MacBook</a>, have I turned soft to
my <a href="http://www.opensource.org/" title="Open Source">Open Source</a>/<a href="http://www.fsf.org/" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software</a> ways? No, definately 100% NOT. I’ll
explain why: I think Apple Computer has an incredible product in Mac OSx. For
anyone who has not used it before, pop into a 3G store and ask to have a go.
When someone releases a good a product as that, they deserve money, in my
opinion. Under “the” free software license (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt" title="GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a>) it
is permissable for anyone to charge for software licensed under it, as long as
an offer of source code is given (for 3 years afterwards). Deep down I love
<a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu</a>, and I will install it as soon as possible when they release a
version for the Intel powered Apple computers. In fact I will use my Laptop to
showcase Ubuntu you had of told me November last year I’d spend well over
€1,000 on an <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>, I would have told you that I hated Apple, and
would never consider it! What has changed my mind? I got a iPod Nano for
Christmas ‘05 and thought it was great, but the Nano on its own still wouldn’t
convince me to get a Mac.</p></p>

                <p><p>I am all for open standards, but they face huge problems. Not least is lack of
intergration between them. Take SIP used by VOIP providers, such as
<a href="http://www.wengo.com/">OpenWengo</a>. While OpenWengo is open source, and it is SIP, they are not
helpful in informing you how to use other clients, or dial other OpenWengo
users from other networks.</p>
<p>What I am really talking about is the need for an all-in-one communications
program, that is multi-platform. Their is already open source code for: Google
Talk (aka Jabber), MSN, AOL, ICQ, SIP, H.323, Yahoo! but why isn’t their an
all-in-one client? Surely it would be easy to reimplement some code from other
programs into Ekiga (SIP, H.323) , Kopete or Gaim (both Jabber, MSN, Yahoo,
AOL and ICQ)? I know GoogleTalk is based on SIP, so why not SIP compatability?
That is poor implementation which is fragmenting the Open Source community,
how are we going to challenge MSN’s userbase with this sort of fragmentation?
That said I like Google Talk and its way of doing things. Also it is rumoured
GoogleTalk will be interoperable with AOL at protocol level, since Google owns
5% of AOL.</p></p>
