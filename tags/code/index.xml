      <title>Scraping Transaction Data from KBC Bank</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I mentioned importing transactions using ledger/hledger and plain text accounting. As my former bank PTSB recently raised their fees, I decided to move to KBC. I was excited to see, as part of the open payments directive, they have a nice developer portal. I reached out to KBC&amp;rsquo;s dev team, but alas they are only accepting registered companies, who meet stringent criteria. They told me they hope to open it up soon to end users, I live in hope!</description>

      <title>Python 3 In-Memory Zip File</title>

      <description>In Python, BytesIO is the way to store binary data in memory. Most examples you’ll see using zip files in memory is to store string data and indeed the most common example you’ll find online from the zipfile module is zipfile.writestr(file_name, &amp;#34;Text Data&amp;#34;). But what if you want to store binary data of a PDF or Excel Spreadsheet that’s also in memory? You could use zipfile.write() (designed to take binary data) but then you can’t specify a filename (since our in-memory file was never written to a location on disk).</description>

      <description>As part of my previous posts, I talked about ledger and plain text accounting. The only part missing is that you need a method to import transactions from your bank. For this I have been doing this by hand, bi-weekly. I would have to do the following:
 Log in to online banking Go to the transactions page Select the date range for transactions I needed (double check last date of transaction in ledger at this point) Download the Microsoft Excel format file that wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the proper format Convert this Excel file into a CSV file that matched my import format (watch the dates, is it YYYY-MM-DD or DD/MM/YYYY?</description>

      <title>Slack Bots for Work</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I mentioned how I get notified of the restaurant menu via a Ruby script. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to a totally different product area and the main communication channel we use is Slack. Naturally enough, I ported the Ruby code I wrote, and it now posts the menu every day to our Slack channel.
This also got me thinking of what other information would be handy to have.</description>

      <title>Automatic Newsletter Cleanup in Gmail</title>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t tried Google Apps Script, I found a really nifty use for it: smart filtering for email. Wait, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I just use Gmails&amp;rsquo; built-in filters? As it turns out you can&amp;rsquo;t - my filter needs to act on email that matched that filter in the past. So in other words: a filter can only act on email it actually &amp;ldquo;filters&amp;rdquo;, which kinda makes sense! I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of automation (and email is ripe for automation), as you can see from my post on meetings in Outlook.</description>

      <description>Continuing the theme of automation, one of the most repetitive tasks if you work for a big company is timesheets. So I set out to rectify this by scripting it!
Start with you configuration, I named mine hours.ini:
[DEFAULT] url = FILL_ME_IN username = FILL_ME_IN password = FILL_ME_IN then we need the magic of Selenium to do the heavy lifting, so we install it:
$ pip3 install selenium I called this script, unsurprisingly hours.</description>

      <title>Automated &#39;Push&#39; Restaurant menu</title>

      <description>I love trying to automate the world, it just feels like magic some of the time! I also really enjoy information coming to me, instead of having to seek it. As we are still only in 2016, we have no world killing Artificial Intelligence (yet). So we have to start small, ease the first world problems! So I decided to make my workplaces&amp;rsquo; restaurant menu come to me!
I decided to write it in Ruby and use push notifications, rather than email or SMS.</description>

      <description>You can follow the Microsoft TechNet guide to add VisualBasic code in Outlook rules.
You can just replace the code they give with this:
Sub AutoDeclineMeetings(oRequest As MeetingItem) &amp;#39; If its not a meeting, we don&amp;#39;t process If oRequest.MessageClass &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &amp;#34;IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request&amp;#34; Then Exit Sub End If &amp;#39; Get the appointment in the meeting Dim oAppt As AppointmentItem Set oAppt = oRequest.GetAssociatedAppointment(True) &amp;#39; Send a decline response Dim oResponse Set oResponse = oAppt.</description>

      <title>Very Simple Java Twitter Bot (Twitter4J)</title>

      <description>Below is code for the start of a Twitter bot I am going to build in Java. It&amp;rsquo;s the most basic way of getting Oauth working (with any account, not just your developer account) and it shows your timeline and can update your status - that&amp;rsquo;s it for now. The neat thing is it uses Java&amp;rsquo;s awesome serialisation, so you only should have to authorise your twitter account once!
What you will need:  Twitter4j Libraries Oauth Consumer and Secret Key off twitter That is it!</description>

      <title>Output Percentage of File (Bash code)</title>

      <description>I wrote this script recently for a friend in a job who needed to output a certain percentage of a log file, but no more and no less. This was in Linux using bash, so I had a go at writing a solution, which you see below. Posting this up in case it&amp;rsquo;s useful to anyone else!
# !/bin/sh # Public Domain, by Neil Grogan 2010 # Script to output last 30% of file by lines OLDFILE=&amp;amp;quot;oldlog.</description>
