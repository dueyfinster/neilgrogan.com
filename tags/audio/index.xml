      <description>So I was listening to some music, thinking about the announcement today on Anglo Irish Bank that we have 32% national debt and my generation will be expected to pay that. Kind of depressing if you ask me, but no one does, ’cause the media has got that one all wrapped up. So I asked myself, is their anything new we can learn, while I was listening to the Prodigy classic� Breathe.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about my desire for open web video before, and now it looks as if it&amp;rsquo;s finally going to happen. Lead by Google&amp;rsquo;s acquisition of On2 technologies, the VP8 codec has been renamed as &amp;ldquo;WebM&amp;rdquo; and open sourced. Vorbis will be the audio. Matroska the container for the new format. An Open Source developer for x264 does a great teardown of the format vs. h.264 here. The patent minefield stateside is still not clear by any means, but with a strong backer like Google, it&amp;rsquo;s probably the best protection your going to get.</description>

      <description>Seriously: what an awesome song. Every Geek should love it! It&amp;rsquo;s got the famous line &amp;ldquo;My heart is human, my blood is boiling, my brain IBM&amp;rdquo;. If this is not in every Geeks top ten songs; then I resign! I even listen to it as I type this! Anyways enough sounding like a DJ who just got his Payola check off the RIAA; I&amp;rsquo;ll just post the free video so y&amp;rsquo;all can watch&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I recorded a tutorial, showing people how to extract YouTube (and other flash based sites videos&amp;rsquo;) and get them onto your iPod. It was recorded on my Mac, so unfortunately its Mac specific, but really only iSquint program is, so if anyone can suggest a replacement on Windows or Linux, I will add it to the details of the video. I use Garageband for audio, iMovieHD to edit the video and audio and Copernicus to record my screen.</description>

      <description>I found this doing a search for Domino Records DRM. I looked up some of my favourite artists to see if they were part of the &amp;ldquo;MAFIAA&amp;rdquo; that is the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), not surprisingly some were (70% of sold music worldwide is put out by this cartel). I got rather confused when a Franz Ferdinand album appeared on the list, when their debut album did not. Seems the record label did a deal with Sony for distribution.</description>

      <description>Even while podcasts are relatively new (well a couple of years - like blogs), Irish Radio Stations are surprisingly well in on the act. Even our incumbent state broadcaster, RTE, is podcasting en-masse on both RTE Radio 1 and RTE 2FM. To recieve podcasts, you need podcasting software, start by getting Juice Reciever(Formerly iPodder), available for Linux, BSD, MAC and Windows. I will start with my top 5 Irish Radio podcasts:</description>
