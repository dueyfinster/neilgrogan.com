<p>In 2002, the British Film Institute depicted popcorn as &ldquo;the most profitable substance on the planet, more than heroin, more than plutonium&rdquo;. Typically, the popcorn we eat costs less to produce than the very container it comes in. - <a href="http://www.afoodieworld.com/en/features/all-features/articles/popcorn.html">Foodie World</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further research indicates that isn&rsquo;t quite true - antimatter is the most expensive substance in the world. But for a common, everyday item, it&rsquo;s very expensive indeed. There&rsquo;s a lot less risk in production then Heroin and a lot bigger market the Plutonium, for instance.<br /></p></p>

blog post for a while, probably since 2006. (Almost) everyone that I
know of donates to charity on a regular enough basis. I&rsquo;m a college
student so I don&rsquo;t donate as much as I should. But it really annoys me
how the &ldquo;main&rdquo; charities run a campaign of guilt and spend <strong>millions</strong>
on it. I&rsquo;ve donated money to all of these charities, the third world aid
charities. All of them spend far too much on paying people commission
and advertising. One that I can think of off hand is asking people who
donated more than €250 to sign a form and send it back.</p></p>

                <p><p>I had a trip in to the faire capital city of Ireland today:
Dublin. Okay I&rsquo;ll get this out of the way: I had a Frappacino in
Starbucks and I&rsquo;m a student; so not too poor of a student ;)</p>
<p>But I saw the inside of Brown Thomas for the first time. I don&rsquo;t shop
for fashion at all: but what I found was the kind of vulgarity and
fake-ness I&rsquo;d expect of London or New York; not Dublin. To paraphrase
Bono: &ldquo;In America if you have your mansion on a hill people look up to
you and think &lsquo;I want to be like him and afford a house like that one
day&rsquo;; if you have the same mansion in Ireland people say &rsquo;look at the
fucken eejit on the hill with that house; thinks he&rsquo;s god or sumthen&rsquo;&rdquo;
and that to me was always an endearing part of Irish culture; people
around you being the great leveller if you thought you were the bomb.
Inside BT (Brown Thomas) was all the names you&rsquo;d expect; all the major
names more at home in Paris, London or New York. I confronted my friend
who was showing me round about my opinions (in my usual polite manner:
just say it). To my surprise he agreed 110%. Yes he said: for the people
who buy this stuff can tell who else is wearing it; and I think he meant
that by this logic movers and shakers also wore all the brands to look
the part. Soon after he told me he was also learning Golf because he
knew it would be a great benefit for his future career: &ldquo;All important
people also play golf&rdquo; he assured me.</p></p>

w<a href="http://about.skype.com/online.png"><img src="http://about.skype.com/online.png" alt="image"></a>ould
Skype&rsquo;s G-branded future be any better?</p>
<p>I think it would be. Skype is a strong international brand for voice
calls, instant messaging and video calls; but of course it competes
directly with Google Talk. Skype as a company has made a lot of
mistakes; but they actually produces some of the best technology for p2p
VOIP out there in the marketplace. Skype is particularly strong in
redundancy, cost of network operation (since it&rsquo;s p2p every user
carries&rsquo; each others traffic; most people have no idea of this fact) and
routing around the most draconian network admins out their through their
routers.</p></p>

selling Ubuntu Linux 7.04 on consumer machines in the United States.
This can only be good news, as a supporter of Linux since late
2004/early 2005 I am fully behind this initiative to put Linux as a
choice in front of people who buy computers. They are testing the market
at the moment which explains why they are shipping stock drivers with
the hardware, and no multimedia codecs (which is unfortunate, but
understandable that this deal was done in 60 days). I think this is
quite an achievement for Canonical and Mark Shuttleworth (Ubuntu
Founder), as they get to do the traditional Linux business model: you
pay for support, and if you don&rsquo;t need it, you don&rsquo;t buy it. This could
confuse some people in the shorter term, but long term its a winner:
Dell does what it does best (Hardware) and Software is left to Ubuntu&rsquo;s
parent company Canonical. This is opposed to Microsoft getting Dell to
provide support for both hardware and software, sometimes a messy
business in which the consumer does not know which to turn to and can
often be left out in the cold. I hope Dell extends this to Europe and
6the rest of the world soon, and makes a decent stab at promoting a free
software desktop. Dell list advantages in one of their videos:</p></p>
