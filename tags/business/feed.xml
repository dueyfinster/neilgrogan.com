Turns out you can mitigate these tricks with a bit of knowledge, as this proves:
But now, with some simple math, you can fight back!
First, letâ€™s see how the MTA tricks you out of your money earlier than you might want to release it to them.</description></item><item><title>Grab the Popcorn!</title><link>/grab-popcorn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/grab-popcorn/</guid><description>Fresh from the &amp;ldquo;interesting but pointless facts&amp;rdquo; desk comes this little kernel (I apologise!) of truth:
In 2002, the British Film Institute depicted popcorn as &amp;ldquo;the most profitable substance on the planet, more than heroin, more than plutonium&amp;rdquo;. Typically, the popcorn we eat costs less to produce than the very container it comes in. - Foodie World
Further research indicates that isn&amp;rsquo;t quite true - antimatter is the most expensive substance in the world.</description></item><item><title>Mobile Carrier Charges</title><link>/mobile-carrier-charges/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/mobile-carrier-charges/</guid><description>This is an old box which contained a Nokia phone from a now defunct Esat Digifone. Irish Businessman Denis O&amp;rsquo;Brien started it and sold it to BT and made a fortune (and after got embroiled in a tribunal on accusations of impropriety). It is now called O2.I thought we got ripped off now with call charges now, how nostalgia can prove one wrong:</description></item><item><title>Donating to Charity</title><link>/donating-to-charity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/donating-to-charity/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write this blog post for a while, probably since 2006. (Almost) everyone that I know of donates to charity on a regular enough basis. I&amp;rsquo;m a college student so I don&amp;rsquo;t donate as much as I should. But it really annoys me how the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; charities run a campaign of guilt and spend millions on it. I&amp;rsquo;ve donated money to all of these charities, the third world aid charities.</description></item><item><title>Innovation Right Here - Dept. of Education is Wrong</title><link>/innovation-right-here-dept-of-education/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/innovation-right-here-dept-of-education/</guid><description>I usually get both of Ireland&amp;rsquo;s daily national papers to my email inbox every morning. I think it&amp;rsquo;s very important to catch up on the latest news; as I think you are more informed and have conversation pieces to talk to people (for those awkward silences where &amp;ldquo;Ye the weather is terrible&amp;rdquo; just won&amp;rsquo;t do). So I was highly informed when I read this piece: DCU head hits out at &amp;lsquo;out-of-date&amp;rsquo; O&amp;rsquo;Keeffe.</description></item><item><title>I've decided - I'm decidedly middle class</title><link>/ive-decided-im-decidedly-middle-class/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ive-decided-im-decidedly-middle-class/</guid><description>I had a trip in to the faire capital city of Ireland today: Dublin. Okay I&amp;rsquo;ll get this out of the way: I had a Frappacino in Starbucks and I&amp;rsquo;m a student; so not too poor of a student ;)
But I saw the inside of Brown Thomas for the first time. I don&amp;rsquo;t shop for fashion at all: but what I found was the kind of vulgarity and fake-ness I&amp;rsquo;d expect of London or New York; not Dublin.</description></item><item><title>Irish Blog Awards</title><link>/irish-blog-awards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/irish-blog-awards/</guid><description>Well apparently I am a new kid on the block, according to the Irish Blog awards blog). Irish Blog Awards from what I can gather is a new event, hoping to happen in March 2007. They have an impressive list of backers, so I expect significant (although maybe minor) coverage in the media. Unfortunately they called it Duey Fensters, but I thank them for the link nonetheless! These are the categories that will be adjudicated on:</description></item><item><title>Million Dollars, Nice!</title><link>/million-dollars-nice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/million-dollars-nice/</guid><description>A student in England has almost reached his target of one million dollars, and he is only 21! He came up with the idea after jotting down ideas before he went to bed on how to become a millionaire before he went to university. Then he came up with the million-dollar idea, sell pixels at USD $1 a piece on his homepage, MillionDollarHomepage.com . This man is Alex Tew, hailed as an advertising genius by the many companies who are using his site to make Internet history.</description></item></channel></rss>
