[My Name]
eircom has not agreed to block any Internet sites from being accessed by
end-users. As part of the settlement of the above proceedings, it was
agreed that eircom would not oppose an application by the Plaintiffs to
seek to have eircom block access to the Pirate Bay website. The Music
Industry will still have to establish, in the normal way that there is
an appropriate basis for the relief which they seek from the Court.</description></item><item><title>Love letter to IRMA's Solicitor</title><link>https://www.neilgrogan.com/love-letter-to-irmas-solicitor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.neilgrogan.com/love-letter-to-irmas-solicitor/</guid><description>This post is a continuation on the previous one. IRMA is the Irish Music Rights Organisation which represents the big four record companies and their bottom line: never the artist. They have recently tried to regulate the Internet and have forced the biggest Irish ISP: Eircom; to use the three strikes rule and boot people off the Internet&amp;hellip; No Judge, no Jury, no evidence of a crime.. Just an IP address and a sanction which you cannot contest.</description></item><item><title>This post is censored by IRMA</title><link>https://www.neilgrogan.com/this-post-is-censored-by-irma/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.neilgrogan.com/this-post-is-censored-by-irma/</guid><description>I always hoped for better for Ireland; but it seems the thieving hand of &amp;ldquo;rights&amp;rdquo; organizations which pretend to represent the artist have struck gold. Being able to cajole and bribe the largest Irish Internet Service Provider (ISP) - Eircom; has worked only too well. Although Eircom has said it will only obey by having a court order - it has agreed never to oppose these - which makes it complicit in the act of censorship.</description></item><item><title>Letter to EU Commissioner on 95 Year Copyright Extension [Updated]</title><link>https://www.neilgrogan.com/year/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.neilgrogan.com/year/</guid><description>I recently read a Slashdot article &amp;ldquo;EU Commissioner proposes 95 year copyright&amp;quot;. I am a staunch supporter of the European project; or at least the ideals it is based on to create a peaceful, demcratic union of countries with a common background and share similiar goals. Intrigued by the article I read it only to find out that a local man who used to represent my area was responsible. I had to write to him to ask how he lost his mind&amp;hellip;.</description></item><item><title>Update on RTE and the Creative Commons</title><link>https://www.neilgrogan.com/update-on-rte-and-creative-commons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 May 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.neilgrogan.com/update-on-rte-and-creative-commons/</guid><description>Unbeknownst to me, with my quick thinking on the positive developments regarding CBS releasing democratic debates under a permissive license in the United States has caused quite a few Irish bloggers to echo my call on RTE&amp;rsquo;s stance on releasing the Irish Election 2007 debates. If you agree we should be allowed to download, remix and share the debates while giving RTE credit for production, please:
Sign the Petition!
UPDATE: Poll is now closed as the leaders debates are now finished.</description></item></channel></rss>
