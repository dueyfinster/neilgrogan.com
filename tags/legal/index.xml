      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;[My Name]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;eircom has not agreed to block any Internet sites from being accessed&#xA;by&lt;br&gt;&#xA;end-users. As part of the settlement of the above proceedings, it&#xA;was&lt;br&gt;&#xA;agreed that eircom would not oppose an application by the Plaintiffs&#xA;to&lt;br&gt;&#xA;seek to have eircom block access to the Pirate Bay website. The&#xA;Music&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Industry will still have to establish, in the normal way that there&#xA;is&lt;br&gt;&#xA;an appropriate basis for the relief which they seek from the Court.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;eircom is not supporting or consenting to the application. The&lt;br&gt;&#xA;settlement makes no provision for any site other than the Pirate Bay&lt;br&gt;&#xA;website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Love letter to IRMA&#39;s Solicitor</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is a continuation on the previous one. IRMA is the Irish&#xA;Music Rights Organisation which represents the big four record companies&#xA;and their bottom line: never the artist. They have recently tried to&#xA;regulate the Internet and have forced the biggest Irish ISP: Eircom; to&#xA;use the three strikes rule and boot people off the Internet&amp;hellip; No Judge,&#xA;no Jury, no evidence of a crime.. Just an IP address and a sanction&#xA;which you cannot contest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always hoped for better for Ireland; but it seems the thieving hand of&#xA;&amp;ldquo;rights&amp;rdquo; organizations which pretend to represent the artist have struck gold.&#xA;Being able to cajole and bribe the largest Irish Internet Service Provider&#xA;(ISP) - Eircom; has worked only too well. Although Eircom has said it will&#xA;only obey by having a court order - it has agreed never to oppose these -&#xA;which makes it complicit in the act of censorship. My Letter to Our ISP,&#xA;Eircom, IRMA, EFF:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Letter to EU Commissioner on 95 Year Copyright Extension [Updated]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read a Slashdot article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/14/1626228&#34;&gt;EU Commissioner proposes 95 year&#xA;copyright&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. I am a&#xA;staunch supporter of the European project; or at least the ideals it is&#xA;based on to create a peaceful, demcratic union of countries with a&#xA;common background and share similiar goals. Intrigued by the article I&#xA;read it only to find out that a local man who used to represent my area&#xA;was responsible. I had to write to him to ask how he lost his mind&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Linux and Patents: Just Patently Wrong</title>
      <link>/linux-and-patents-just-patently-wrong/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I read the news &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/12/novell_red_hat_linux_patent_sued/&#34;&gt;Novell and Red Hat are being sued for&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;This is all about multiple workspaces that can hold various graphical&#xA;user elements, a Xerox Parc patent which dates to the early 1990&amp;rsquo;s.&#xA;Xerox Palo Alto Research center invented the graphical user interface in&#xA;the 1980&amp;rsquo;s, only to been, licensed and used by Steve Jobs in Mac OS&#xA;Classic. Now IP Innovation, a submarine patent troll, who make no&#xA;products and bought the patent want their payday. The logical step is to&#xA;go after the biggest infringer to set a precedent for your patent, and&#xA;then make your way to all the smaller companies who infringe. Well&#xA;logically of course that would be Apple or Microsoft. Apple has already&#xA;paid them a reported 20 million dollars, and well no-one knows what&#xA;Microsoft has done, but this fish is smelly. From the Register&#xA;Article:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Apple - Play Nice....</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../img/07/AppleLogo.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../img/07/AppleLogo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Is the much beloved Apple the new Microsoft? First there was IBM, the&#xA;big all crushing corporate machine that was humbled by the next big&#xA;giant in the form of Microsoft, so it seems Apple&amp;rsquo;s turn is long&#xA;overdue. The next few weeks are crucial to this crossroads in which&#xA;Apple finds itself: It owes a HUGE amount to the BSD (an open source&#xA;Unix clone) which is the foundation for not just OS X, but the iPhone&#xA;and now the iPod Touch. Basically without the kernel that runs these&#xA;fantastic devices, Apple would still be up shit creek without a paddle.&#xA;Granted the iPod would have been a huge success probably still, but OS&#xA;X&amp;rsquo;s core is the foundation for the real money making Apple will do over&#xA;the next few years, a point that is not lost on Mr. Jobs as the company&#xA;intelligently markets different segments to different markets of which I&#xA;have first hand experience of: Go to the Apple site for education and&#xA;they extol the brilliance of a Macbook and make they deal sweeter by&#xA;throwing in an iPod Nano. But if you go to a link I was provided in a&#xA;college advert; they bring to a page pointing out key areas a mac can&#xA;make a difference. I picked Computer Science naturally, and the site&#xA;extolled the virtues of Open Source, a Unix base and programming tools&#xA;like Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Update on RTE and the Creative Commons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to me, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dueyfinster.com/2007/05/irish-elections-creative-commons.html&#34; title=&#34;RTE, Irish Elections &amp;amp; Creative Commons&#34;&gt;my quick thinking on the positive developments&#xA;regarding CBS releasing democratic&#xA;debates&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;under a permissive license in the United States has caused&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ferguscassidy.ie/2007/05/08/one-for-everyone-in-the-audience/&#34;&gt;quite&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cearta.ie/2007/05/speech-just-wants-to-be-free/&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mulley.net/2007/05/08/first-come-the-parodies/&#34;&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irishelection.com/05/web-roundup-day-10/&#34;&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; to echo&#xA;my call on RTE&amp;rsquo;s stance on releasing the Irish Election 2007 debates. If&#xA;you agree we should be allowed to download, remix and share the debates&#xA;while giving RTE credit for production, please:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.petitiononline.com/Speech/petition.html&#34; title=&#34;RTE Creative Commons Petition&#34;&gt;Sign the&#xA;Petition!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this doing a search for Domino&#xA;Records DRM. I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.riaaradar.com/&#34; title=&#34;RIAA Radar&#34;&gt;looked up some of my favourite&#xA;artists&lt;/a&gt; to see if they were&#xA;part of the &amp;ldquo;MAFIAA&amp;rdquo; that is the&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA&#34; title=&#34;Recording Industry Association of America&#34;&gt;RIAA&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;(Recording Industry Association of America), not surprisingly some were&#xA;(70% of sold music worldwide is put out by this cartel). I got rather&#xA;confused when a Franz Ferdinand album appeared on the list, when their&#xA;debut album did not. Seems the record label did a deal with Sony for&#xA;distribution. I found a piece of information quite old now (May 2006),&#xA;but interesting anyway:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick&#xA;blurb about some things Microsoft like to say: Don&amp;rsquo;t believe it, well at&#xA;least not it all anyway. On the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/ireland/getthefacts/default.mspx&#34; title=&#34;Irish Get the Facts&#34;&gt;Irish &amp;ldquo;Get the Facts&amp;rdquo;&#xA;page&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;(on Windows Server vs. Linux), they make critical errors of judgement a&#xA;person reasonably well versed in computing could deconstruct. First of&#xA;all, Linux isn&amp;rsquo;t a server, its a kernel, like the Windows kernel. So&#xA;comparing &amp;ldquo;Windows Server 2003&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; is misleading to say the&#xA;least, and stupid to say the most. You could run any server software on&#xA;Linux you wished, even Windows Server 2003 if Microsoft ported it! For&#xA;the sake of argument, I think they are comparing themselves to Apache,&#xA;which runs 60% of worldwide&#xA;servers&lt;a href=&#34;http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/01/05/january_2007_web_server_survey.html&#34; title=&#34;Netcraft Server Marketshare&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Law and the Interweb</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing this because, I regret to say, the stupidity of humanity. People&#xA;nowadays define their own law on the Web and the Internet (don’t know the&#xA;difference, you should), while disregarding real life. Maybe its a lack of&#xA;understanding about technology or law, I don’t know. One things for sure,&#xA;common sense can go a long way. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thecommitments.net/&#34; title=&#34;The Commitments Official Website&#34;&gt;Take for example this website on the&#xA;Commitments&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits linking from unauthorised sites!&#xA;You see? I just broke the law right there, amazing dontcha think? The person&#xA;who designed or put the statement up, is a total complete and utter idiot, and&#xA;I don’t care if thats considered slander! Imagine if every site was to do&#xA;this? Search engines would be just another litagation filled business, like so&#xA;many other. With Lawyers reviewing every site to go into the database, Google&#xA;would have a handful, maybe a 100 sites, instead of the usual billions it&#xA;indexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
