This is all about multiple workspaces that can hold various graphical

Xerox Palo Alto Research center invented the graphical user interface in
the 1980&rsquo;s, only to been, licensed and used by Steve Jobs in Mac OS
Classic. Now IP Innovation, a submarine patent troll, who make no
products and bought the patent want their payday. The logical step is to
go after the biggest infringer to set a precedent for your patent, and
then make your way to all the smaller companies who infringe. Well
logically of course that would be Apple or Microsoft. Apple has already
paid them a reported 20 million dollars, and well no-one knows what
Microsoft has done, but this fish is smelly. From the Register

Is the much beloved Apple the new Microsoft? First there was IBM, the
big all crushing corporate machine that was humbled by the next big
giant in the form of Microsoft, so it seems Apple&rsquo;s turn is long
overdue. The next few weeks are crucial to this crossroads in which
Apple finds itself: It owes a HUGE amount to the BSD (an open source
Unix clone) which is the foundation for not just OS X, but the iPhone
and now the iPod Touch. Basically without the kernel that runs these
fantastic devices, Apple would still be up shit creek without a paddle.
Granted the iPod would have been a huge success probably still, but OS
X&rsquo;s core is the foundation for the real money making Apple will do over
the next few years, a point that is not lost on Mr. Jobs as the company
intelligently markets different segments to different markets of which I
have first hand experience of: Go to the Apple site for education and
they extol the brilliance of a Macbook and make they deal sweeter by
throwing in an iPod Nano. But if you go to a link I was provided in a
college advert; they bring to a page pointing out key areas a mac can
make a difference. I picked Computer Science naturally, and the site
extolled the virtues of Open Source, a Unix base and programming tools
like Xcode.</p></p>

person reasonably well versed in computing could deconstruct. First of
all, Linux isn&rsquo;t a server, its a kernel, like the Windows kernel. So
comparing &ldquo;Windows Server 2003&rdquo; to &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; is misleading to say the
least, and stupid to say the most. You could run any server software on
Linux you wished, even Windows Server 2003 if Microsoft ported it! For
the sake of argument, I think they are comparing themselves to Apache,
which runs 60% of worldwide
