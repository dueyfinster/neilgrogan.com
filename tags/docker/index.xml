      <description>I recently started using PiHole to block ads on my home network. As the name suggests, you install it on a raspberry pi. I left it in situ for about a month, until I decided I wanted to swap out the pi, but keep PiHole.
The natural solution to this, is to use a docker container. Rather helpfully, there is a publicly available docker build of PiHole. Simple, right? Well my home network is also IPv6, thus the DNS on the raspberrypi should be also.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Docker ever since I started to use it, approximately a year after it was started. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those technologies where when you start to use it, you immediately know it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a sea change in how things are done in the industry. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely going to be more impactful then Virtual Machines.
We&amp;rsquo;ve used Docker to great effect where I work. We&amp;rsquo;re building a huge system called Ericsson Network Manager, which will manage the networks of the future.</description>
