It&rsquo;s one of those technologies where when you start to use it, you immediately know it&rsquo;s going to be a sea change in how things are done in the industry. It&rsquo;s definitely going to be more impactful then Virtual Machines.
We&rsquo;ve used Docker to great effect where I work. We&rsquo;re building a huge system called Ericsson Network Manager, which will manage the networks of the future.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 2, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../bell-curve/>Bell Curve is Wrong</a></h2><div><p>Interesting study here: apparently performance of people in a company is never related to a bell curve, but is more like a ski slope. So the majority of people are carried by the few in terms of performance. What I really want to know is pay for these people like a ski slope? Cause I bet it ain&rsquo;t.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 11, 2014</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../doc-it-please/>Document it Please</a></h2><div><p>Very good technical documentation skills are a must for any Software Engineer - to explain how a system works in detail forces you to think about the flaws present within the design. &ldquo;Bad smells&rdquo; of documentation often can be a sign of weaknesses on your product. Is this section too verbose or did we make it too complex for the customer? Should we explain ancillary parts of our system (either operating system components or other applications?</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 22, 2013</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../is-4k-the-new-3d-the-networked-society-blog/>Is 4K the new 3D? - The Networked Society Blog</a></h2><div><p>I&rsquo;d love to own a 4K screen, the more lifelike the images the better it&rsquo;ll be for movies. I&rsquo;d imagine filesizes are 4x as large as HD also, which will be an issue that might kill off optical storage (and require better broadband). It&rsquo;s a shame the author tried to compare it to 3D (which objectively is still a flop) but he mentions the issues in that technology (namely: field of vision).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 23, 2012</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../software-engineering-job/>Software Engineering Job</a></h2><div><p>I had been applying for jobs since I started my last year in college and I am delighted to say even before I completed my final year, I have gained full time employment. I would say it is luck, but my family thinks it&rsquo;s down to a lot of hard work and good grades! Either way, it&rsquo;s a great feeling in probably the most competitive jobs market (for potential employees) in years.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 13, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../open-sourcing-your-cv/>Open Sourcing your CV</a></h2><div><p>Just like software. it can be really useful to open source other things in life, collaboration is nearly always a good thing. John Buckman, CEO of Magnatune Records knows this principle all too well. He gave a speech at a Red Hat conference a while back, and he talked about the importance of music artists sharing the &ldquo;source&rdquo;, i.e. basically sharing the method of how the produced the music in the first place.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 1, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../fon-new-job-and-commuting/>FON, New Job and Commuting!</a></h2><div><p>I regularly read other Irish blogs to see whats happening and whats the latest tech thing amongst others. It seems that may have come to fruition, with FON, a community wifi project, sending me out a free router!! I am exicted about this, as I hope to convince all my neighbours eventually to get it, and maybe who knows, I may even achieve the biggest fon hotspot, if I take my campaign estate wide, to neighbours all around!</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 4, 2006</time></div></article></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=../../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
