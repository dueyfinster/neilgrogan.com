It&rsquo;s interesting the different approach each company is taking.
Chrome ad:
To me the Chrome ad is very family oriented, stressing the utility of the web and the ease of reaching people and staying in touch. No surprise they didn&rsquo;t feature Facebook, which is what the vast majority use to keep in touch.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 30, 2012</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../firefox-and-opera-lead-web-video-way/>Firefox and Opera lead the web video way</a></h2><div><p>I downloaded Firefox 3.1 beta 2 (after trialling other development snapshots over the last few months) to see Ogg Theora video support is coming on really well. Opera, as well as Mozilla has committed to including this royalty-free video codec for web use. This is really good news; as one Opera Developer said:
Something however is still not quite there about web video.

Adblock Plus; because ads are for people that don&rsquo;t know how to avoid them! Not only do they stop your banwidth from being wasted; they make a ton of websites more usuable. It takes care of Flash Ads as well as static ones; using a filter that is constantly updated. So even if some of the webs more devious and sneaky advertisers try to circumvent it; AdBlock can have a fix to everyone online within hours.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 29, 2008</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../internet-explorer-thanks-firefox/>Internet Explorer thanks Firefox, sincerely?</a></h2><div><p>Reading my favourite tech news site: Slashdot ( /.), I see the Internet Explorer team have sent the Firefox Team a nice cake:
One comment I read said it all really:
Seems even the IE team knows that IE is dead.
As for the ex-lax, bugs, pubes in the cake of course none of that is true. Those things would only be possible if someone at Microsoft actually made the cake, and that&rsquo;s not how MS does things.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 26, 2006</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../mozillas-millions/>Mozilla's Millions</a></h2><div><p>Only now is it truly becoming clear, their is [serious money in Open Source][]/ With Mozilla reported to have made tens of millions of dollars.
