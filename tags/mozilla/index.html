<p>To me the Chrome ad is very family oriented, stressing the utility of the web and the ease of reaching people and staying in touch. No surprise they didn&rsquo;t feature Facebook, which is what the vast majority use to keep in touch.<br /></p></p>

<p>Something however is still not quite there about web video. The video

on plugins to display in a web page - what we need to make video a
first-class web citizen is an easy, open solution to integrate video
into web pages, and native support for video in browsers.</p></p>

Plus</a>; because ads
are for people that don&rsquo;t know how to avoid them! Not only do they stop
your banwidth from being wasted; they make a ton of websites more
usuable. It takes care of Flash Ads as well as static ones; using a
filter that is constantly updated. So even if some of the webs more
devious and sneaky advertisers try to circumvent it; AdBlock can have a
fix to everyone online within hours. It is definately my favourite
extension! I don&rsquo;t block certain ads like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft (the
ones with decent reputations) as that is how the people behind really
good websites I frequent make a living. But for all the rest trying to
do pop-ups and pop-unders; I am sorry your days are numbered! (Some
people higly recommend
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433">flashblock</a> but I
haven&rsquo;t had a need to use it with AdBlock Plus yet).<br>

adds neat tricks to Google services such as always using a secure
connection to Gmail; links to other search engines, page histories,
Favicons to search and streaming results pages. Comes in handy once in a
while; but I don&rsquo;t use it daily.</p></p>

<p>One comment I read said it all really:</p>

<p>Seems even the IE team knows that IE is dead.</p>
<p>As for the ex-lax, bugs, pubes in the cake of course none of that is
true. Those things would only be possible if someone at Microsoft
actually made the cake, and that&rsquo;s not how MS does things. They knew
they couldn&rsquo;t make a good cake so they just went out and bought a cake
from someone who already knew how to make one and then stuck their
logo on it and called it theirs.</p></p>

One blogger reported 70m was made by the corporation, with a Mozilla insider
confirming thats a reasonable ballpark figure. Christopher Blizzard, board
member of Mozilla, had this to say on his blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blizzard added that an earnings figure of $72m (£41m) quoted on some
blogs was incorrect. “I won’t comment on the dollar amount except to
say that it’s [$72m] not correct, though not off by an order of
magnitude. I also won’t comment on sources of that money, except to
say that some of the assertions that I’ve seen in the comments are
pretty far off, both in terms of numbers and sources,</p></p>
