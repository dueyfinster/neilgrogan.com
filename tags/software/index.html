                <p><p>For the last few years, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to budget properly and see where my
money was going. But like all habits that are good for you, looking after your
finances takes time, care and attention. I started off by researching the market
for budgeting software. A lot of the prepackged software out there was very
US-centric, including Quicken, Microsoft Money and
<a href="https://www.mint.com">Mint.com</a>. I eventually settled on and bought a license
for <a href="https://www.ynab.com">You Need a Budget</a>, because: it had a budgeting
methodology, very good Euro support and was cross platform with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR">Adobe Air</a>. YNAB lasted me well for a
few years, with its pretty graphs and ease of expense entry. I even liked their
much pared-down companion iOS app at the time.</p></p>

                <p><p>I recently read an article that posed the question &ldquo;<a href="http://nerdgap.com/does-your-dock-reflect-your-priorities/">Does your dock reflect your
priorities?</a>&rdquo; - which is an interesting question. Further breaking that idea down
leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>What apps do I need the most?</li>
<li>What apps should be next (or be higher priority)?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iphone-dock">iPhone dock</h3>
<img src="../../files/2012/07/iphone.png" alt="iPhone homescreen" />
<ul>
<li><em>Phone app</em>: pretty self explanatory</li>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Still the best mobile browser I think (though if Google ever gets
going on a proper Chrome browser for Android that may change)</li>
<li><em>Tweetbot</em>: I like Twitter the most of the social networks and tweetbot is the
Swiss army knife if twitter clients</li>
<li><em>Music</em> (aka. iPod app) : I use my iPhone in my car and sometimes at work to
listen to music</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ipad-dock">iPad dock</h3>
<img src="../../files/2012/07/ipad.png" alt="iPhone homescreen" />
<ul>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Safari on iPad is not as good as the iPhone version - it can be more
full featured I think!</li>
<li><em>Mail app</em>: E-mail on the iPad is one of the most popular uses, it&rsquo;s got just
the right amount of screen real-estate to do it justice</li>
<li><em>Photography folder</em>: I don&rsquo;t know why I mistook myself as being interested in
photography, but here&rsquo;s a folder I almost never use (bar camera app)</li>
<li><em>Music</em>: I like it uses the screen real-estate better then the iPhone version
and it&rsquo;s much nicer to browse music on</li>
<li><em>Tweetbot</em>: Tweetbot for iPad is the best Twitter client for iPad hands down
(on the iPhone it&rsquo;s more contested) and sync with Tweetmarker makes it much
easier moving between iPhone and iPad versions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve learned I make pretty bad use of the dock on both devices.
<a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> or <a href="http://www.lastpass.com">Lastpass</a> should probably be in the dock on either device -
probably with a feed reader as a close run after that (Reeder or Mr. Reader).
These apps feature on either home screen as you can see from the screenshots
above. Food for thought I guess!</p></p>

male dominated environments, such as Computer Science. For me it has never
mattered someone&rsquo;s gender - I love using, tweaking and learning about computers
and if you share that interest - the more, the better! It has been shown very
young children are conditioned from a very young age by gender rules - shown by
Prof. Robert Winston in Child of Our Time programme. So I&rsquo;ve often wondered in a
very skewed ratio of males to females (as generally there are more females than
males in society) would affect a Woman&rsquo;s choice of even considering Computer
Science, since so few actually do. So I set about asking our class
representative, <strong><em>Lauren Butler</em></strong>, her thoughts on Computers, doing Computer
Science and being an authority figure in a male dominated class-room, my
questions and her answers follow:</p></p>

<p>I would add a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager">file manager</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">browser</a> to this list also! Let&rsquo;s
look at the two most popular consumer Operating Systems (in three variants) and

Linux; really a Kernel, but packaged means an Operating System. Which way you
package it makes all the difference! You still use the same drivers, the boot
process is still the same, but when your machine finishes its boot and launches
all that graphics stuff anything can appear: <strong>anything</strong>. It&rsquo;s abstraction to
have no real graphics in a kernel other than that which are drivers to control
hardware. This is very strange to people who think in the Windows way (nb. I
used to be one of these). At the end of Windows XP booting I have never seen
anything but Luna; and most people don&rsquo;t know its called that. So it is very
strange for people my age and slightly older who grew up over DOS and Windows
3.1/95 line to have this fundamental shift in logic.</p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>Last year was me celebrating four years of using the best operating system out
there: <a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux</a> and the best distro <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. Ubuntu was my first foray in to
Linux; and I haven&rsquo;t left it since; although I have tried all the other major
distros. I started with the first version of Ubuntu; Warthy Warthog:</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png/180px-Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png" alt="Warthy Warthog"></p>
<p>Warthy had a text only installer and it took me quite a while to not only get
used to the idea of this strange operating system; but the fear of leaving
Windows-land where all that power usage knowledge would mean nothing. It meant
nothing in terms of the registry and other superficial stuff; but the more I
used Ubuntu and Linux the more I liked it. In fact in 2005 I ditched my XP
installation altogether. I noticed there wasn&rsquo;t an Irish Ubuntu users group; so
I mailed one of the few people (around 5 I guess) that were around Mark
Shuttleworth to set it up and get a website going. It was an ill-advised effort
since I was too busy with examinations really to take it on; so I gave it up
soon after. But it is still going today, people are still involved.</p></p>

<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 4.2 beta 2. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know; KDE is
the <a href="http://www.kde.org/">K Desktop Environment</a>; which includes a window
manager (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwin">KWin</a>), common desktop
applications, its own menu

<ul>
<li>**What is so special about KDE? **<br>
The philosophy of KDE is the advanced configuration it allows through its
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI">Graphical User Interface</a> (GUI), this is
versus <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> which chooses sane defaults and leaves
configuration in hard to reach places and out-of-sight. This isn&rsquo;t to say KDE
doesn&rsquo;t choose sane defaults; it does and is very user-friendly. KDE has
always been the more Windows-like of the major desktop environments and this
hasn&rsquo;t really changed in KDE 4.X series. KDE is available in popular
distributions of Linux such as Kubuntu, <a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva</a>,
<a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/">OpenSuse</a>. The special part about 4.X series is
that for the first time for any Linux desktop environment; it is fully
cross-platform, easily installs and works on Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac
OS X.</li>

What makes it so good? Have you ever heard of Amarok? Chances are if your an OS

                <p><p>Well first of all, there has been some blog updates, inspired no less by my
Grandfather! He&rsquo;s at a fragile old age, so he can&rsquo;t read the screen all too
well. This is not a problem however, as he sets all fonts to 16 and higher in
<a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> (which is out of beta and into version 2.0!). That got me thinking,
as I really struggled to read this page being marginally away from the screen,
as I am a [Keratoconus][] sufferer. As a result, I have enlarged all fonts in my
blog, in an effort to make them more readable&hellip; I encourage everyone to do the
same, or at least follow the [web standards][] so that it can be properly auto resized
by browsers.</p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>I feel I need to confess why I am buying a <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macbook/macbook.html" title="MacBook">MacBook</a>, have I turned soft to my
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/" title="Open Source">Open Source</a>/<a href="http://www.fsf.org/" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software</a> ways? No, definately 100% NOT. I’ll explain
why: I think Apple Computer has an incredible product in Mac OSx. For anyone who
has not used it before, pop into a 3G store and ask to have a go. When someone releases
a good a product as that, they deserve money, in my opinion. Under “the” free software
license (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt" title="GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a>) it is permissable for anyone to charge
for software licensed under it, as long as an offer of source code is given (for
3 years afterwards). Deep down I love <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu</a>, and I will install it as soon
as possible when they release a version for the Intel powered Apple computers.
In fact I will use my Laptop to showcase Ubuntu you had of told me November last
year I’d spend well over €1,000 on an <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>, I would have told you that
I hated Apple, and would never consider it! What has changed my mind? I got a iPod
Nano for Christmas ‘05 and thought it was great, but the Nano on its own still wouldn’t
convince me to get a Mac.</p></p>

With <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/" title="Mozilla Corp">Mozilla</a> reported to have made tens of millions of dollars. One blogger
reported 70m was made by the corporation, with a Mozilla insider confirming
thats a reasonable ballpark figure. Christopher Blizzard, board member of
Mozilla, had this to say on his blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blizzard added that an earnings figure of $72m (£41m) quoted on some blogs was
incorrect. “I won’t comment on the dollar amount except to say that it’s
[$72m] not correct, though not off by an order of magnitude. I also won’t
comment on sources of that money, except to say that some of the assertions
that I’ve seen in the comments are pretty far off, both in terms of numbers
and sources,</p></p>

                <p><p>One of the biggest complaints of Linux is that software doesn’t install to well,
or is very difficult to install. “Dependency Hell” (When software relies on
other bits of software to work), used to be quite commonplace. Ubuntu has
cleaned a lot of dependency hell up, and a new program for installing software
from the internet, is included in the new version, due to be released 1st
June 2006.</p>
<p>That’s when I discovered a little gem called <a href="http://klik.atekon.de/" title="Klik it!">Klik</a> for many Linux
distributions. Simply lookup the piece of software you need, click on it and you
have it! No need to install! It places the whole program on the desktop, so it
is easily deletable and easily transferable. For example, if you have an office
application, and your friend doesn’t, simply copy that file on desktop to your
usb key or a cd, and copy to friends pc, done and dusted - Your friend has the
whole application! This is an obvious feature bonus over current Windows
version, XP.</p></p>
