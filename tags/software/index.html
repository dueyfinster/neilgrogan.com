But like all habits that are good for you, looking after your finances takes time, care and attention. I started off by researching the market for budgeting software. A lot of the prepackged software out there was very US-centric, including Quicken, Microsoft Money and Mint.com. I eventually settled on and bought a license for You Need a Budget, because: it had a budgeting methodology, very good Euro support and was cross platform with Adobe Air.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 10, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../whats-in-your-dock/>What's in your dock?</a></h2><div><p>I recently read an article that posed the question &ldquo;Does your dock reflect your priorities?&rdquo; - which is an interesting question. Further breaking that idea down leads to:
What apps do I need the most? What apps should be next (or be higher priority)? iPhone dock Phone app: pretty self explanatory Safari: Still the best mobile browser I think (though if Google ever gets going on a proper Chrome browser for Android that may change) Tweetbot: I like Twitter the most of the social networks and tweetbot is the Swiss army knife if twitter clients Music (aka.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 23, 2012</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../notepad-a-great-windows-editor/>Notepad++: A Great Windows Editor</a></h2><div><p>I spend a lot of my day in heavy development tools such as Eclipse1, but often for editing simple XML I just want a quick tool to make fast changes. If I use the CLI (or Linux) it&rsquo;ll be Vim, if I&rsquo;m on Mac it&rsquo;ll be Textmate but on Windows it&rsquo;s Notepad++.

You may ask what does that mean? - well it is simple. I love going to websites that are uncluttered, provide useful information and are to the point.

Wikipedia defines it as:
In graphical computing, a desktop environment (DE) commonly refers to a style of graphical user interface &mldr;&mldr; A desktop environment typically consists of icons, windows, toolbars, folders, wallpapers, and desktop widgets. (See WIMP.)
I would add a file manager and browser to this list also!

Ubuntu was my first foray in to Linux; and I haven&rsquo;t left it since; although I have tried all the other major distros. I started with the first version of Ubuntu; Warthy Warthog:
Warthy had a text only installer and it took me quite a while to not only get used to the idea of this strange operating system; but the fear of leaving Windows-land where all that power usage knowledge would mean nothing.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 21, 2009</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../beta-2/>KDE 4.2 Beta 2</a></h2><div><p>Recently I downloaded the Kubuntu packages of the new KDE 4.2 beta 2. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know; KDE is the K Desktop Environment; which includes a window manager (KWin), common desktop applications, its own menu (Kickoff), browser (Konqueror), file manager (dolphin) etc. Basically it is the most popular desktop environment on Linux next to Gnome.

My Top 10 Apps of 2007 in descending order:
10. Spybot Search and Destroy
Always a must on spyware infested Windows XP installs I come across (Unfortunately all to often).

This is not a problem however, as he sets all fonts to 16 and higher in Firefox (which is out of beta and into version 2.0!).

No, definately 100% NOT. I’ll explain why: I think Apple Computer has an incredible product in Mac OSx. For anyone who has not used it before, pop into a 3G store and ask to have a go. When someone releases a good a product as that, they deserve money, in my opinion.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 12, 2006</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../new-design-ranking-gmail-hosted-os-2006/>New Design, Ranking, Gmail Hosted, OS 2006 Finale and YouOS</a></h2><div><p>Hope you like the new look Duey Finsters.
