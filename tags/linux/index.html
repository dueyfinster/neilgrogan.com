                <p><p>I recently replaced a rusty satellite dish and faulty LNB (it has been in use in
the house I moved in to for 10+ years I&rsquo;d guess) and decided to try install one
myself. Here in Ireland, the two main broadcast methods of receiving TV are
satellite (<a href="https://www.freesat.co.uk/">Freesat</a> / <a href="https://www.sky.com/ie/">Sky</a>) and terrestrial aerial (<a href="https://www.saorview.ie/">Saorview</a>).</p>
<p>An issue I have one larger sitting room TV and one small living room TV. I
couldn&rsquo;t get both to be Samsung (out of stock on smallest sizes - which seem to
be going out of fashion). So both TVs had very different methods of switching
between satellite and aerial connections. I&rsquo;m not sure if it is a hardware
limitation (they make switching tuners slow to hide this), a licensing issue
(broadcasters pay to be on the <a href="https://www.freesat.co.uk/">Freesat</a> EPG for example) or a software issue
(seems least likely). The fact multiple TV brands (in my case Phillips/Samsung)
make it this clunky - makes me think it&rsquo;s a licensing issue. I wanted to solve
this by using an external box and having one mental model for navigating
broadcast TV.</p></p>

for Mac OS X as a desktop and how he used to feel guilty about it (given his very
impressive open source credentials).</p>
<p>I used to feel the same also. Android even as a platform more closely follows my
ideals, yet I am exclusively an avid iOS user at this point. But as I&rsquo;ve learned
more, the importance of pragmatism is clear. I use my personal iOS devices for
countless hours a day and I really just want them to work. I want them to work
in the way they were designed to do: quickly check email, browse the web, make
calls, check messages and so forth.</p></p>

a subscription to sites like
<a href="http://www.lynda.com" title="Lynda Training Videos">Lynda.com</a>. Between those and
Youtube, I&rsquo;ve watched an awful lot of technology how-to videos and 90% of them
are quite poor in terms of editing, sound and being coherent/properly scripted.
Sometimes though it&rsquo;s a joy to genuinely learn something new in a short, concise
and to the point video.</p>

<p>This haktip is right up there with being among the best: short, concise, to the
point and about a utility that will be super-useful to me. In work I&rsquo;m in an
agile software development team and I spend a lot of time on the command line. I
<strong>like</strong> the command line, but many don&rsquo;t (personal preference I guess). As part
of being agile, we produce a lot of video demos to stakeholders. Increasingly
though the demos we produce are just as useful for the team - you can&rsquo;t be every
team member at once and this provides huge visibility to the team of progress.
Our software is a Unix product, but we develop on Windows - so Camtasia is
usually used - which is fine for GUI demos. This handy utility will be great to
demo CLI stuff we do.</p></p>

<p>I switched from Ubuntu Linux, which is very much built for new people to Linux.
I have been using Ubuntu since it&rsquo;s release in 2004 (as old as this blog
incidentally). I have found it slowly moving away from my power user needs from
the release of the KDE 4.0 desktop up to the recently introduced Unity desktop
for Ubuntu. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love the whizz-bang effects of the snazzier
distributions (like Ubuntu) and have used it to show people the power of Linux
(and how really groundbreaking Compiz effects were at the time, ~2005). It&rsquo;s sad
Compiz hasn&rsquo;t got the kudos but since both Windows and OS X have copied from
Compiz, some more usability has been gained.</p></p>

Linux; really a Kernel, but packaged means an Operating System. Which way you
package it makes all the difference! You still use the same drivers, the boot
process is still the same, but when your machine finishes its boot and launches
all that graphics stuff anything can appear: <strong>anything</strong>. It&rsquo;s abstraction to
have no real graphics in a kernel other than that which are drivers to control
hardware. This is very strange to people who think in the Windows way (nb. I
used to be one of these). At the end of Windows XP booting I have never seen
anything but Luna; and most people don&rsquo;t know its called that. So it is very
strange for people my age and slightly older who grew up over DOS and Windows
3.1/95 line to have this fundamental shift in logic.</p></p>

                <p><p>Last year was me celebrating four years of using the best operating system out
there: <a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux</a> and the best distro <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. Ubuntu was my first foray in to
Linux; and I haven&rsquo;t left it since; although I have tried all the other major
distros. I started with the first version of Ubuntu; Warthy Warthog:</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png/180px-Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png" alt="Warthy Warthog"></p>
<p>Warthy had a text only installer and it took me quite a while to not only get
used to the idea of this strange operating system; but the fear of leaving
Windows-land where all that power usage knowledge would mean nothing. It meant
nothing in terms of the registry and other superficial stuff; but the more I
used Ubuntu and Linux the more I liked it. In fact in 2005 I ditched my XP
installation altogether. I noticed there wasn&rsquo;t an Irish Ubuntu users group; so
I mailed one of the few people (around 5 I guess) that were around Mark
Shuttleworth to set it up and get a website going. It was an ill-advised effort
since I was too busy with examinations really to take it on; so I gave it up
soon after. But it is still going today, people are still involved.</p></p>

always been the more Windows-like of the major desktop environments and this
hasn&rsquo;t really changed in KDE 4.X series. KDE is available in popular
distributions of Linux such as Kubuntu, <a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva</a>,
<a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/">OpenSuse</a>. The special part about 4.X series is
that for the first time for any Linux desktop environment; it is fully
cross-platform, easily installs and works on Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac
OS X.</li>

This is all about multiple workspaces that can hold various graphical user
elements, a Xerox Parc patent which dates to the early 1990&rsquo;s. Xerox Palo Alto
Research center invented the graphical user interface in the 1980&rsquo;s, only to
been, licensed and used by Steve Jobs in Mac OS Classic. Now IP Innovation, a
submarine patent troll, who make no products and bought the patent want their
payday. The logical step is to go after the biggest infringer to set a precedent
for your patent, and then make your way to all the smaller companies who
infringe. Well logically of course that would be Apple or Microsoft. Apple has
already paid them a reported 20 million dollars, and well no-one knows what
Microsoft has done, but this fish is smelly. From the Register Article:</p></p>

I
just tried Herd 5 of Gutsy Gibbon, a beta release which will be Ubuntu 07.10
released in October. Obviously it is still early stages and a lot of things
aren&rsquo;t working quite as they should, but it looks very promising. Here&rsquo;s some
new stuff which should hit the final release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiz Fusion - Pretty Graphics that leave you in awe&hellip;</li>
<li>Bullet Proof X - Making sure you&rsquo;ll never see a terminal prompt not of your
own choosing, basically the graphics server should be &lsquo;bulletproof&rsquo;</li>
<li>Appearance Manager - Making it easier to change yourbuntu&rsquo;s look and feel</li>
<li>Better Driver Support - More of those restricted drivers to make sure you can
see your screen and use your wifi card</li>
<li>Simplified Codecs install - It will now be painless, install
ubuntu-restrictedcodecs (or kubuntu-restricted codecs) and you can see Youtube
in all its glory, play a dvd, watch that porno WMV file (just kidding but I
think thats all WMV is used for) and other such niceties of the propreitry
world we have to put up with</li>
<li>Firefox Codecs Plugin - Firefox will be hooked up to the package manager and
prompt to install Flash/Java if you haven&rsquo;t got it already, much the same way
it prompts to get a codec when you throw a file at it that it cannot play in
the movie player. The free software Gnash replacement for Flash will come as
standard and can play Youtube Vids.</li>
<li>Dual Screen Glory - If your like me you have a nice and small portable laptop,
but that screen just won&rsquo;t do all of the time, thats why I personally have a
19&quot; to plug my 13&quot; MacBook into. With Gutsy I should be able to plug and play
over DVI.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the features that are being worked on for the final
release. Probably not all of them on the list will get into Gutsy final, but
lets hope they do! Gutsy+1 (slated for release April 2008) has been announced as
&ldquo;Hardy Hereon&rdquo; and should be a long term release (5 years server and 3 years
desktop updates and
patches).<a href="http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg" alt="image"></a></p></p>

His facts do raise an issue of slow patching of vulnerabilities across the

                <p><p>Dell Computers has started selling Ubuntu Linux 7.04 on consumer machines in the
United States. This can only be good news, as a supporter of Linux since late
2004/early 2005 I am fully behind this initiative to put Linux as a choice in
front of people who buy computers. They are testing the market at the moment
which explains why they are shipping stock drivers with the hardware, and no
multimedia codecs (which is unfortunate, but understandable that this deal was
done in 60 days). I think this is quite an achievement for Canonical and Mark
Shuttleworth (Ubuntu Founder), as they get to do the traditional Linux business
model: you pay for support, and if you don&rsquo;t need it, you don&rsquo;t buy it. This
could confuse some people in the shorter term, but long term its a winner: Dell
does what it does best (Hardware) and Software is left to Ubuntu&rsquo;s parent
company Canonical. This is opposed to Microsoft getting Dell to provide support
for both hardware and software, sometimes a messy business in which the consumer
does not know which to turn to and can often be left out in the cold. I hope
Dell extends this to Europe and 6the rest of the world soon, and makes a decent
stab at promoting a free software desktop. Dell list advantages in one of their
videos:</p></p>

do you convince people the latest and greatest is worth the money? Microsoft is
in a tough position due to stiff competition - old, working, fully-compatible
windows machines don&rsquo;t disappear into thin air. There has been a lot more FUD
(Fear Uncertainty and Doubt)abput Vista already from the Free and Open Source
camp. Some of the harsh critiscims will be justified, others probably not.
Regardless this will not hurt Microsofts marketing whatsoever, the average user
doesn&rsquo;t share concerns over digital restriction/rights management - yet.
Microsoft say it will be on 100m PC&rsquo;s by years end. I don&rsquo;t think it will be as
fast as Microsoft would like, due to: 1) People wait for service packs. 2)
People don&rsquo;t upgrade PC&rsquo;s as fast now. Most things people identify their
computer with is increasingly online, a worrying trend if I were Microsoft, this
creates platform independence for the average user, granted not the gamers, or
other highly specialised software vendors.</p></p>

iPod Nano (1st Gen 4GB) and now a 80GB iPod Video! I bought i for a couple of
reasons, namely price and storage. I had been put off before since I thought
they were too bulky ( I know a couple of people who have older generation iPod
Videos) after being with the Nano for over a year (its still chugging along
gleefully). What can I say? I am impressed! Battery life is huge to me and well
to be frank, its amazing. My first MP3 player was a Creative Nomad Jukebox II
(circa 2002), which I still have. I know only one person who owned an MP3 player
before me, and its nice to be there from the start, you appreciate the little
details most people don´t, as they are new to mp3 players, so they expect it as
standard. I now get all the latest tech podcasts, so I am very happy with that!</p></p>

why: I think Apple Computer has an incredible product in Mac OSx. For anyone who
has not used it before, pop into a 3G store and ask to have a go. When someone releases
a good a product as that, they deserve money, in my opinion. Under “the” free software
license (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt" title="GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a>) it is permissable for anyone to charge
for software licensed under it, as long as an offer of source code is given (for
3 years afterwards). Deep down I love <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu</a>, and I will install it as soon
as possible when they release a version for the Intel powered Apple computers.
In fact I will use my Laptop to showcase Ubuntu you had of told me November last
year I’d spend well over €1,000 on an <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>, I would have told you that
I hated Apple, and would never consider it! What has changed my mind? I got a iPod
Nano for Christmas ‘05 and thought it was great, but the Nano on its own still wouldn’t

cleaned a lot of dependency hell up, and a new program for installing software
from the internet, is included in the new version, due to be released 1st
June 2006.</p>
<p>That’s when I discovered a little gem called <a href="http://klik.atekon.de/" title="Klik it!">Klik</a> for many Linux
distributions. Simply lookup the piece of software you need, click on it and you
have it! No need to install! It places the whole program on the desktop, so it
is easily deletable and easily transferable. For example, if you have an office
application, and your friend doesn’t, simply copy that file on desktop to your
usb key or a cd, and copy to friends pc, done and dusted - Your friend has the
whole application! This is an obvious feature bonus over current Windows

the brighest star, Ubuntu really does outshine other Linuxes, with usability,
features and great range of software. Now you can try Ubuntu on Windows.</p>

different. Most people don’t see this distinction, that although the two OSes do
many of the same functions, they remain lightyears apart. I have to admit I
preach Linux to the hilt, I shouldn’t, but I do. I get skeptical Windows users
who ask me what Linux does better, and I am stuck for an answer, as it does a
lot of tasks better.</p></p>

on vibramycin antibiotics. I was coughing blood (not nearly as nasty as it

guide to restricted formats on Ubuntu soon, especially W32 Codecs and how to get
all the good formats it offers (Divx, MPEG1-4, Windows Media, Quicktime Media
and RealMedia)</p></p>
