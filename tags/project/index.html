                <p><p>As part of my undergradute thesis, I found a template (for LyX) to ease the pain of formatting a thesis in LaTeX. Making it look just right to me was very important. If your are writing a thesis, perhaps you feel the same way? If so, read on&hellip;</p>
<p>While doing my first undergraduate thesis in Computer Science, I found a template used for a Computer Science thesis in NUI Maynooth (a university in Ireland). What attracted me was simple: it was battle tested and easily customisable. That was 2011 and since then I&rsquo;d pretty much forgotten about it.</p></p>

                <p><p>For my final year project, I have done a web application on the
concept of replacing traditional web applications. I picked an area
I  was deeply interested in, smart phones. I am an avid iPhone user
and I  have bought Android phones also, they are great devices I can&rsquo;t
imagine  not having now that they are here. As part of my thesis I
touched on the  old way to develop apps, using Symbian C++ or J2ME and
we&rsquo;ve come a  long, long way since then.<br /><br />For those interested,
I will  publish copy of my thesis after November 2011. I won&rsquo;t publish
it here  just yet, as the examiners have yet to pour over the contents
and grade it.</p></p>

                <p><p>As part of Computer
Science you do a couple of general modules which are general in nature
about computing; but I think that just reflects the broad use of IT in
every part of society today. As things go digital or are created
digitally; understanding of this concept is vital; that is where Web
Multimedia comes in. For my first project of this second year; I had to
do a movie made of stills with custom sound effects. Restrictions on
sources of images and sounds (very high percentage had to be self made).

Linux Gaming a shot. I am not much of a gamer myself and most websites
aren&rsquo;t very helpful or have too small a focus (only shoot-em-ups, or
only certain Linux distros etc.). Inspired by the fine folks at
OpenSourceMac.org and OpenSourceWindows.org, I announce my own project:
Ultimate Games Disc. UGD is a project I think I can make very
successful. My aims are as follows:</p></p>
