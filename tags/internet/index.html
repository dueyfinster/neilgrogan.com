world famous for the invention of <acronym title="World Wide Web">WWW</acronym>

particle that gives energy mass - exists.</p>
<p>The CERN tour is completely free and highly recommended. I visited the <a href="http://atlas.ch/">Atlas
experiment</a> with a colleague (who just so happened to have a Phd. in
Physics) and questions were encouraged at every turn. What impressed me the most
was the fact that there was no stupid questions. You can be a Phd weilding
Physicist or a child and each question was handled the same by the staff. The
guide (an active researcher at CERN) even expressed disappointment at the Higgs:</p></p>

                <p><p>Nokia have announced an upgrade to the N800 Internet tablet, called the N810. I
suspect its called that because it is more of an incremental upgrade than a
total visual refresh it was going from an Nokia 770 to N800. Here it is:</p>

<p>(Picture Courtesy:
<a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/10/17/the-nokia-n810-internet-tablet/">Internet Tablet Talk</a>)</p>
<p>It sports a nice new hardware keyboard; inbuilt GPS (For satellite mapping) and
OS 2008 (an upgrade to the operating system it runs). The N800 will also benefit
from OS 2008, which will include GoogleTalk, Skype, Mozilla browser, among the
usual such as its email client, media player, file manager, control panel,
assorted games and an image/PDF viewer. The one feature it will emit is an
inbuilt FM Radio, which was axed to make the N810 a smaller tablet. It still
retains the best screen size for web browsing, bluetooth connectivity, and of
course Wifi which is central to the tablets existance! No word on what easter
eggs are included if any; on the N800 it was a radio and the N770 it was the
microphone.

best blogging tool (and it is open source). I looked up the fabulous theme site
to go with it, and I came across this one and liked it very much. The last
design was my own, but I had awful trouble implementing to look the same in all
browsers (especially Internet Explorer, even the latest one, argh). I know the
old one can be improved, so I am submitting to
<a href="http://themes.wordpress.net/" title="Wordpress Themes">WP Themes directory</a>, which I
will update this post with the link. I love the new theme, it brings what I
couldn&rsquo;t to the old one: choosable colours and sameness across browsers. I&rsquo;d
like to thank Justin Winslow for that! Did I mention that the exact same colours
are used in this theme? It brings a total different look though, the power of
perception! So now you know these are the official DF&rsquo;s colours!</p></p>

                <p><p>I am embarking on a journey I believe everyone should: digitise as much photo,
video and documents you can. It serves as a record of your existance, a guide to
people of what your life was like. Why? is the most obvious question you might
ask. Well I will tell you what prompted me, which is the culmination of a lot of
different things.</p>
<p>This brings me to the first reason: Television. I find shows fascinating where
people discover their ancestors were orphans, incredibly wealthy or died from
exhaustion in a mine. It really makes you think what makes you the person you
are, so to speak. David Attenborough says (although I have paraphrased) that if
people look back at his 100-150 hours of television, they will get a snapshot of
what the glaciers, mountains, desert and animals were like in the latter half of
the twentieth century, not a complete picture, but one nonetheless of what Earth
was like at that time.</p></p>

I got to register NeilGrogan.com (My actual name) which I hadn&rsquo;t bothered with before.
AOL is the legal owner however, so has all the say legally to the name. At the minute
it provides 100 2GB email accounts with the free domain, and if you visit the address
online, it redirects to an AIM Pages profile of the owner (for all intents and purposes,
it&rsquo;s another social networking site). Its a good way to drum up interest in its online
offerings, but they should be more flexible. If anyone is in any doubt, this is just
an &lsquo;alright&rsquo; kind of deal, AOL say they will give you the option to buy the name
back in the future, but I won&rsquo;t hold my breath.</p></p>
