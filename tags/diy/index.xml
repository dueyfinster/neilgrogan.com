      <description>I recently replaced a rusty satellite dish and faulty LNB (it has been in use in the house I moved in to for 10+ years I&amp;rsquo;d guess) and decided to try install one myself. Here in Ireland, the two main broadcast methods of receiving TV are satellite (Freesat / Sky) and terrestrial aerial (Saorview).&#xA;An issue I have one larger sitting room TV and one small living room TV. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get both to be Samsung (out of stock on smallest sizes - which seem to be going out of fashion).</description>
