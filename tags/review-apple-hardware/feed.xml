I have obviously been so quick to review this device, the iPhone 5 is upon us! My philosophy for reviewing items is you have to live with them. Well boy have I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do marvel at how good the hardware is. I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped this extremely expensive device on occasions too numerous to count, so luckily it is designed well.</description></item><item><title>iPhone 3G Review</title><link>https://www.neilgrogan.com/iphone-3g-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.neilgrogan.com/iphone-3g-review/</guid><description>I recently got an iPhone 3G and away from all that Apple mania; I thought I would give an honest review. This is framed in the mindset of all the past Nokia devices (which I have posted about here also) which I have owned.
Okay so where to start? Well I think a good place would be what I could have bought instead. Strange place for a review; but its good to see what is out there and what I was looking at beforehand.</description></item></channel></rss>
