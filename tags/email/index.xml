      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.flickr.com/54/136808455_58aae5f13d_t.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;CAN Spam&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spam has become a fact of life nowadays, but is their anything we can do to&#xA;stop it? The answers boils down to no, we canâ€™t. If we make it illegal, the&#xA;spamsters move abroad or go underground, as we have seen in the United States.&#xA;People have been prosecuted, but again this does not deter people. Spamhaus&#xA;have a novel idea, by trusting domains on reputation, based on spam reports.&#xA;But this has one fatal flaw, it involves people reporting spam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
