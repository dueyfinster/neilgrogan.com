<a href="http://www.google.ie/">Google</a> is muling over taking Skype off of Ebay&rsquo;s hands.
Ebay has already written down the value of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">Skype</a> as a large loss on their purchase
price of $2.6 billion in stock and cash. But
w<a href="http://about.skype.com/online.png"><img src="http://about.skype.com/online.png" alt="image"></a>ould
Skype&rsquo;s G-branded future be any better?</p>
<p>I think it would be. Skype is a strong international brand for voice calls,
instant messaging and video calls; but of course it competes directly with
Google Talk. Skype as a company has made a lot of mistakes; but they actually
produces some of the best technology for p2p VOIP out there in the marketplace.
Skype is particularly strong in redundancy, cost of network operation (since
it&rsquo;s p2p every user carries&rsquo; each others traffic; most people have no idea of
this fact) and routing around the most draconian network admins out their
through their routers.</p></p>

domains</a>. There are a few caches however, one must be in possession of a US mobile
phone (cell) number. Luckily I have a cousin stateside willing to help out ;-) .
I got to register NeilGrogan.com (My actual name) which I hadn&rsquo;t bothered with before.
AOL is the legal owner however, so has all the say legally to the name. At the minute
it provides 100 2GB email accounts with the free domain, and if you visit the address
online, it redirects to an AIM Pages profile of the owner (for all intents and purposes,
it&rsquo;s another social networking site). Its a good way to drum up interest in its online
offerings, but they should be more flexible. If anyone is in any doubt, this is just
an &lsquo;alright&rsquo; kind of deal, AOL say they will give you the option to buy the name
back in the future, but I won&rsquo;t hold my breath.</p></p>

Worlds Information”. While it is what you expect from Google, the Calendar did
not impress me a whole lot. It does have an intuitive interface, that is easy to
use. It does integrate with Gmail, although the full extent has yet to be seen,
as they fall short of mentioning it in Gmail at all, but I would expect this to
change. I see great potential for users though, and where Google is heading.
They will eventually integrate it with GoogleTalk and Gmail, producing a hybrid
interface where you can organise a conference on GoogleTalk, schedule it on your
calendar (which is syncronised with your PC and your workgroup server [therby
informing fellow employees]), submit video of it to Google Video, write minutes with
writely, email minutes with Gmail, that mail (with document and video) being attached
to the meeting on the Calendar, which is in turn archived on your PC in Google Desktop
and your Gmail Drive. While that is only one scenario, it is very possible. Google
have already leaked information on their eagerness to hold the entire contents of
ones&rsquo; hard drive on the internet.</p></p>

                <p><p>I am all for open standards, but they face huge problems. Not least is lack of
intergration between them. Take SIP used by VOIP providers, such as
<a href="http://www.wengo.com/">OpenWengo</a>. While OpenWengo is open source, and it is SIP, they are not
helpful in informing you how to use other clients, or dial other OpenWengo users
from other networks.</p>
<p>What I am really talking about is the need for an all-in-one communications
program, that is multi-platform. Their is already open source code for: Google
Talk (aka Jabber), MSN, AOL, ICQ, SIP, H.323, Yahoo! but why isn’t their an
all-in-one client? Surely it would be easy to reimplement some code from other
programs into Ekiga (SIP, H.323) , Kopete or Gaim (both Jabber, MSN, Yahoo, AOL
and ICQ)? I know GoogleTalk is based on SIP, so why not SIP compatability? That
is poor implementation which is fragmenting the Open Source community, how are
we going to challenge MSN’s userbase with this sort of fragmentation? That said
I like Google Talk and its way of doing things. Also it is rumoured GoogleTalk
will be interoperable with AOL at protocol level, since Google owns 5% of AOL.</p></p>

                <p><p>What a fantastic service Google now offer with their Google Video platform.
There are a couple of reasons why I like it, mainly because it is available to
upload your videos on all platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) and is available on
Mozilla-based browsers (Firefox, Netscape), Opera and Internet Explorer.This is
important in creating a better all round user experience. If only Yahoo! would
follow Googles example and open up Launch Cast to other browsers besides an
outdated version of Netscape and Internet Explorer.</p></p>

                <p><p>While using instant messenger I had a brainwave, what will the tech landscape
look like in the future? So here is What I think could happen: IBM will buy Sun
MicroSystems and make a new opensource OS, it will be based on Ubuntu. Microsoft
will purchase AOL and roll out its products on the Web, such as MS Office, it
will have a slow start to Vista, but it will pick up through peoples eagerness
to buy the latest hardware. Google will buy Opera, invest in Mozilla and
consolidate Opera into Mozilla, it will also buy Adobe (for their PDF format),
get its way to publish an online bookstore through Google Book Search. Yahoo
will continue to buy extra companies to add to its list of a zillion services,
such as Flickr and Del.icio.us.</p></p>
