He&amp;rsquo;s at a fragile old age, so he can&amp;rsquo;t read the screen all too well. This is not a problem however, as he sets all fonts to 16 and higher in Firefox (which is out of beta and into version 2.0!). That got me thinking, as I really struggled to read this page being marginally away from the screen, as I am a [Keratoconus][] sufferer.</description></item></channel></rss>
