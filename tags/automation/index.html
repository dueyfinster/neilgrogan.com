As my former bank PTSB recently raised their fees, I decided to move to KBC. I was excited to see, as part of the open payments directive, they have a nice developer portal. I reached out to KBC&rsquo;s dev team, but alas they are only accepting registered companies, who meet stringent criteria. They told me they hope to open it up soon to end users, I live in hope!</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 13, 2019</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../bank-tx-py/>Scraping Data from your Bank in Python</a></h2><div><p>As part of my previous posts, I talked about ledger and plain text accounting. The only part missing is that you need a method to import transactions from your bank. For this I have been doing this by hand, bi-weekly. I would have to do the following:
Log in to online banking Go to the transactions page Select the date range for transactions I needed (double check last date of transaction in ledger at this point) Download the Microsoft Excel format file that wasn&rsquo;t in the proper format Convert this Excel file into a CSV file that matched my import format (watch the dates, is it YYYY-MM-DD or DD/MM/YYYY?</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 12, 2017</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../slack-bot/>Slack Bots for Work</a></h2><div><p>In a previous post, I mentioned how I get notified of the restaurant menu via a Ruby script. Recently I&rsquo;ve moved to a totally different product area and the main communication channel we use is Slack. Naturally enough, I ported the Ruby code I wrote, and it now posts the menu every day to our Slack channel.
This also got me thinking of what other information would be handy to have.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 16, 2017</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../gmail-newsletter-filter/>Automatic Newsletter Cleanup in Gmail</a></h2><div><p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried Google Apps Script, I found a really nifty use for it: smart filtering for email. Wait, shouldn&rsquo;t I just use Gmails&rsquo; built-in filters? As it turns out you can&rsquo;t - my filter needs to act on email that matched that filter in the past. So in other words: a filter can only act on email it actually &ldquo;filters&rdquo;, which kinda makes sense! I&rsquo;m a big fan of automation (and email is ripe for automation), as you can see from my post on meetings in Outlook.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 19, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../autohours/>Fill hours worked in SAP Netweaver Automatically</a></h2><div><p>Continuing the theme of automation, one of the most repetitive tasks if you work for a big company is timesheets. So I set out to rectify this by scripting it!
Start with you configuration, I named mine hours.ini:
[DEFAULT] url = FILL_ME_IN username = FILL_ME_IN password = FILL_ME_IN then we need the magic of Selenium to do the heavy lifting, so we install it:
$ pip3 install selenium I called this script, unsurprisingly hours.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 1, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../rest-menu/>Automated 'Push' Restaurant menu</a></h2><div><p>I love trying to automate the world, it just feels like magic some of the time! I also really enjoy information coming to me, instead of having to seek it. As we are still only in 2016, we have no world killing Artificial Intelligence (yet). So we have to start small, ease the first world problems! So I decided to make my workplaces&rsquo; restaurant menu come to me!
I decided to write it in Ruby and use push notifications, rather than email or SMS.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 10, 2016</time></div></article></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=../../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
