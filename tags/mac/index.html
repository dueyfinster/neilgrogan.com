                <p><p>I recently read an article that posed the question &ldquo;<a href="http://nerdgap.com/does-your-dock-reflect-your-priorities/">Does your dock reflect your priorities?</a>&rdquo; - which is an interesting question. Further breaking that idea down leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>What apps do I need the most?</li>
<li>What apps should be next (or be higher priority)?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iphone-dock">iPhone dock</h3>
<img src="../../files/2012/07/iphone.png" alt="iPhone homescreen" />
<ul>
<li><em>Phone app</em>: pretty self explanatory</li>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Still the best mobile browser I think (though if Google ever gets going on a proper Chrome browser for Android that may change)</li>
<li><em>Tweetbot</em>: I like Twitter the most of the social networks and tweetbot is the Swiss army knife if twitter clients</li>
<li><em>Music</em> (aka. iPod app) : I use my iPhone in my car and sometimes at work to listen to music</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ipad-dock">iPad dock</h3>
<img src="../../files/2012/07/ipad.png" alt="iPhone homescreen" />
<ul>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Safari on iPad is not as good as the iPhone version - it can be more full featured I think!</li>
<li><em>Mail app</em>: E-mail on the iPad is one of the most popular uses, it&rsquo;s got just the right amount of screen real-estate to do it justice</li>
<li><em>Photography folder</em>: I don&rsquo;t know why I mistook myself as being interested in photography, but here&rsquo;s a folder I almost never use (bar camera app)</li>
<li><em>Music</em>: I like it uses the screen real-estate better then the iPhone version and it&rsquo;s much nicer to browse music on</li>
<li><em>Tweetbot</em>: Tweetbot for iPad is the best Twitter client for iPad hands down (on the iPhone it&rsquo;s more contested) and sync with Tweetmarker makes it much easier moving between iPhone and iPad versions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve learned I make pretty bad use of the dock on both devices. <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> or <a href="http://www.lastpass.com">Lastpass</a> should probably be in the dock on either device - probably with a feed reader as a close run after that (Reeder or Mr. Reader). These apps feature on either home screen as you can see from the screenshots above. Food for thought I guess!</p></p>

<p>While some seem to be not impressed by Leopard, it is by all accounts an
OS upgrade, with every major application recieving attention. To me I am
overjoyed the finder is getting a revamp, though I am not certain
following iTunes layout is such a good idea. I think this is Steve Jobs
(CEO. Apple Inc) idea to &ldquo;switch&rdquo; windows people since they already use
iTunes, although I am not sure it is the right path. I choose Mac OS X
because its unique, it has a fresh take on how a user interacts with a
computer, moreso than Linux (which adopts tried and true in the case of
Gnome and KDE), and certainly Windows which has only tweaked the look
since Windows 95: its the same concept. The fanning out of dock icons,
and grouping them won&rsquo;t be used by the vast majority of users: its the
same reason they don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;smart&rdquo; folders: its a feature that has
little in the way of wide appeal. I know the same can be said of the
dashboard, and I personally will most likely end up buying and using
fanning out and collections in Leopard, but my experience of novices is
that they are afraid of the unknown.</p></p>

<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.mactivate.ie/">Mactivate</a> got it wrong, it wasn&rsquo;t the
heatsink, <a href="../../2006/11/01/macbook-issue-identified.html">as referred to by my earlier post</a>. Looks like I have seen good
advice from the Web, never buy a first generation <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> product, until
they work out the kinks! I guess Mactivate have been snowed under with
heatsink problems, that they never bothered to check other parts of my
Macbook, since it is such a common problem.They have ordered me a new &ldquo;logic
board&rdquo; (I am guessing the <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319">PMU</a> like I thought it was ;-) ). In other news
<a href="http://www.macfixit.com/article.php/2006110107475681#">Apple released a firmware update</a> for those poor unfortunates that have
been suffering Random Shutdown Syndrome (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)">RSS</a>) for short :-D ).
Hopefully I should have it back by this Tuesday (November 7th) plus a new
heatsink and logic board&hellip;. fingers crossed anyway!</p></p>

one on order from <a href="http://www.apple.ie/">Apple</a>, so it will take a bit longer than I anticipated
to get my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">Macbook</a> back. I found this strange as I had not experienced
random shutdowns like the ones that have been widely reported across the web.
it was like I described in my earlier post, something to do with the battery
not being able to charge. Then again, I am no expert on this and their is wide
evidence (over 1600 people have identified heatsink as a problem in their
Macbooks) that the heatsink is a definite issue. Sounds like good or bad I
will have a lot more to say about Apple Computer in the future, thats why I
have decided to add them as a category.</p></p>
