      <description>One cannot help but be amazed at Kilkenny; true masters of the Irish Gaelic Sport of hurling. I mean as my previous posts mention I have moved to Kilkenny; and rural South Kilkenny at that. They live and breath Hurling down here: it&amp;rsquo;s literally a way of life. That is why they are so good; no mystery here folks: its is literally bred into children in schools and everyone plays it.</description>
