I use the calender, chat, code, sites, pages, docs the whole lot. One of my friends even jokes &amp;ldquo;You should just work at Google Marketing&amp;rdquo;. Yes I like most of Google&amp;rsquo;s products; but I am a products guy; I use whats good, cheap and fast (pick two). Google has the cheap down due to ad-revenue; for the moment anyways in the current financial turmoil.</description></item><item><title>Google Video</title><link>https://www.neilgrogan.com/google-video/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.neilgrogan.com/google-video/</guid><description>What a fantastic service Google now offer with their Google Video platform. There are a couple of reasons why I like it, mainly because it is available to upload your videos on all platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) and is available on Mozilla-based browsers (Firefox, Netscape), Opera and Internet Explorer.This is important in creating a better all round user experience. If only Yahoo! would follow Googles example and open up Launch Cast to other browsers besides an outdated version of Netscape and Internet Explorer.</description></item></channel></rss>
