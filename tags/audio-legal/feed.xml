I looked up some of my favourite artists to see if they were part of the &amp;ldquo;MAFIAA&amp;rdquo; that is the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), not surprisingly some were (70% of sold music worldwide is put out by this cartel). I got rather confused when a Franz Ferdinand album appeared on the list, when their debut album did not. Seems the record label did a deal with Sony for distribution.</description></item></channel></rss>
