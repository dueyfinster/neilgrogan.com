Between those and Youtube, I&rsquo;ve watched an awful lot of technology how-to videos and 90% of them are quite poor in terms of editing, sound and being coherent/properly scripted. Sometimes though it&rsquo;s a joy to genuinely learn something new in a short, concise and to the point video.
This haktip is right up there with being among the best: short, concise, to the point and about a utility that will be super-useful to me.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 29, 2012</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../hollywood-tech/>Hollywood Tech</a></h2><div><p>I always enjoy watching shows like CSI for the over-the-top depiction of current technology. They obviously have people in know, it&rsquo;s not like the script writers of major shows cannot get someone to consult them on technology (or maybe they don&rsquo;t - sometimes I do wonder).
The video below is about IRC (Internet Relay Chat). They are correct it&rsquo;s primitive (it&rsquo;s all text) and hackers do actually use it (groups like Anonymous), but you can&rsquo;t track someone to their living room using just an IP address!</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 22, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../tech-video-podcasts-worth-watching/>Tech Video Podcasts Worth Watching</a></h2><div><p>I try to listen to as many podcasts (netcasts?) as I can.

Lead by Google&rsquo;s acquisition of On2 technologies, the VP8 codec has been renamed as &ldquo;WebM&rdquo; and open sourced. Vorbis will be the audio. Matroska the container for the new format. An Open Source developer for x264 does a great teardown of the format vs. h.264 here. The patent minefield stateside is still not clear by any means, but with a strong backer like Google, it&rsquo;s probably the best protection your going to get.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 30, 2010</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../pulp-fiction-theme/>Pulp Fiction theme</a></h2><div><p>When I found this, I had to share it:</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>December 4, 2009</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../cheesy-intel-ad/>Cheesy Intel Ad</a></h2><div><p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>December 2, 2009</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../firefox-and-opera-lead-web-video-way/>Firefox and Opera lead the web video way</a></h2><div><p>I downloaded Firefox 3.1 beta 2 (after trialling other development snapshots over the last few months) to see Ogg Theora video support is coming on really well. Opera, as well as Mozilla has committed to including this royalty-free video codec for web use. This is really good news; as one Opera Developer said:
Something however is still not quite there about web video. The video solutions mentioned above are proprietary closed solutions that rely on plugins to display in a web page - what we need to make video a first-class web citizen is an easy, open solution to integrate video into web pages, and native support for video in browsers.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>December 9, 2008</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../gmail-video-chat/>Gmail Video Chat</a></h2><div><p>I am an avid Gmail user through Google Apps.

There are a couple of reasons why I like it, mainly because it is available to upload your videos on all platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) and is available on Mozilla-based browsers (Firefox, Netscape), Opera and Internet Explorer.This is important in creating a better all round user experience.
