                <p><p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I regularly watch technology podcasts and I&rsquo;ve had
a subscription to sites like
<a href="http://www.lynda.com" title="Lynda Training Videos">Lynda.com</a>. Between those and
Youtube, I&rsquo;ve watched an awful lot of technology how-to videos and 90% of them
are quite poor in terms of editing, sound and being coherent/properly scripted.
Sometimes though it&rsquo;s a joy to genuinely learn something new in a short, concise
and to the point video.</p>
<iframe src="http://revision3.com/html5player-v12777?external=true&width=555&height=312" width="555" height="312"  frameborder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen" ></iframe>
<p>This haktip is right up there with being among the best: short, concise, to the
point and about a utility that will be super-useful to me. In work I&rsquo;m in an
agile software development team and I spend a lot of time on the command line. I
<strong>like</strong> the command line, but many don&rsquo;t (personal preference I guess). As part
of being agile, we produce a lot of video demos to stakeholders. Increasingly
though the demos we produce are just as useful for the team - you can&rsquo;t be every
team member at once and this provides huge visibility to the team of progress.
Our software is a Unix product, but we develop on Windows - so Camtasia is
usually used - which is fine for GUI demos. This handy utility will be great to
demo CLI stuff we do.</p></p>

It is easily the most powerful about the event, much more so than Fahrenheit
9/11. In fact I would even argue, that if this documentary had of aired during
the U.S. presedential election, I would have bet on a different result. Backed
up by trusted resources such as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm" title="BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well">BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19
highjackers are alive and well</a>. Filled with outrageous facts, it sets the
scene for either a highly competent Bush regime that new what it was doing, or
the worst domestic tragedy that happend under maladministration. Either way the
American people have serious questions to ask, which I hope in time will get the
aired in time. Maybe George W. is taking a leaf out of Charlie Haugheys book?
That is that corruption can be a force for the good of the public, and my rich

There are a couple of reasons why I like it, mainly because it is available to
upload your videos on all platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) and is available on
Mozilla-based browsers (Firefox, Netscape), Opera and Internet Explorer.This is
important in creating a better all round user experience. If only Yahoo! would
