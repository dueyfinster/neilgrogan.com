Lifehacker has written about this over the years, and the Wirecutter has a great article I shared here on this very blog. Also Casey linked to a great post by Katie Floyd on Twitter:

I finally took the hint / inspiration from all these posts, and I decided time was right to put together my own &amp;ldquo;go bag&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Going on Holidays?

Some of the cities in the itinerary:
Amsterdam Cologne NÃ¼rburgring (Rock Am Ring festival) Prague Bratislava I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely post up some pictures when I get back. I planned this trip with a few classmates to coincide with the completion of our four year honours degree in Computer Science.</description></item><item><title>German Trip</title><link>/german-trip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/german-trip/</guid><description>I recently travelled to Munich, Germany on a recent exchange (1st-9th Feb, 2006). Not knowing what to expect, I found a very different Germany from the text book one you read about (Bavarian Trad Dress, Beer-drinking, Pretzel Eating, Sausage loving etc!). Of course all of these elements were present, but I think a modern German society closely reflects American one, in a lot of ways. Germans are the largest group by ethnicity in United States, so maybe its just German culture prevalent in America?</description></item></channel></rss>
