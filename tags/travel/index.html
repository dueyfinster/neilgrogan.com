Lifehacker has written about this over the years, and the Wirecutter has a great article I shared here on this very blog. Also Casey linked to a great post by Katie Floyd on Twitter:

I finally took the hint / inspiration from all these posts, and I decided time was right to put together my own &ldquo;go bag&rdquo;.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 1, 2015</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../holiday-gadgets/>Going on Holidays?

In between work, I managed to get some time over the Swiss national holiday to visit the CERN. CERN is world famous for the invention of WWW and of course most recently, the almost certainty that the Higgs Boson (aka. &ldquo;The God Particle&rdquo;) - the particle that gives energy mass - exists.
The CERN tour is completely free and highly recommended. I visited the Atlas experiment with a colleague (who just so happened to have a Phd.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 3, 2013</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../inter-railing-around-europe/>Inter-railing around Europe</a></h2><div><p>As you read this, I have already embarked on an inter-railing trip around Europe. Some of the cities in the itinerary:
Amsterdam Cologne NÃ¼rburgring (Rock Am Ring festival) Prague Bratislava I&rsquo;ll definitely post up some pictures when I get back. I planned this trip with a few classmates to coincide with the completion of our four year honours degree in Computer Science.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 2, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../fon-new-job-and-commuting/>FON, New Job and Commuting!</a></h2><div><p>I regularly read other Irish blogs to see whats happening and whats the latest tech thing amongst others. It seems that may have come to fruition, with FON, a community wifi project, sending me out a free router!! I am exicted about this, as I hope to convince all my neighbours eventually to get it, and maybe who knows, I may even achieve the biggest fon hotspot, if I take my campaign estate wide, to neighbours all around!</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 4, 2006</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../german-trip/>German Trip</a></h2><div><p>I recently travelled to Munich, Germany on a recent exchange (1st-9th Feb, 2006). Not knowing what to expect, I found a very different Germany from the text book one you read about (Bavarian Trad Dress, Beer-drinking, Pretzel Eating, Sausage loving etc!). Of course all of these elements were present, but I think a modern German society closely reflects American one, in a lot of ways. Germans are the largest group by ethnicity in United States, so maybe its just German culture prevalent in America?</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 13, 2006</time></div></article></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><script src=../../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
