<p>I finally took the hint / inspiration from all these posts, and I decided time
was right to put together my own &ldquo;go bag&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s a picture of my tech go bag:</p></p>

                <p><p>I am currently in Switzerland on a business trip. In between work, I managed to
get some time over the Swiss national holiday to visit the
<acronym title="European Nuclear Research Centre">CERN</acronym>. <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/">CERN</a> is
world famous for the invention of <acronym title="World Wide Web">WWW</acronym>
and of course most recently, the almost certainty that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson">Higgs Boson</a>
(<acronym title="also known as">aka</acronym>. &ldquo;The God Particle&rdquo;) - the
particle that gives energy mass - exists.</p>
<p>The CERN tour is completely free and highly recommended. I visited the <a href="http://atlas.ch/">Atlas
experiment</a> with a colleague (who just so happened to have a Phd. in
Physics) and questions were encouraged at every turn. What impressed me the most
was the fact that there was no stupid questions. You can be a Phd weilding
Physicist or a child and each question was handled the same by the staff. The
guide (an active researcher at CERN) even expressed disappointment at the Higgs:</p></p>

<li>Nürburgring (Rock Am Ring festival)</li>
<li>Prague</li>
<li>Bratislava</li>

<p>I&rsquo;ll definitely post up some pictures when I get back. I planned this trip with

                <p><p>I regularly read other Irish blogs to see whats happening and whats the latest
tech thing amongst others. It seems that may have come to fruition, with FON, a
community wifi project, sending me out a free router!! I am exicted about this,
as I hope to convince all my neighbours eventually to get it, and maybe who
knows, I may even achieve the biggest fon hotspot, if I take my campaign estate
wide, to neighbours all around! I want to “eat my own dog food” as they say, so
I will wait until I have recieved and used my router before I recommend it to
non-technical people. I have read of long delays on FON’s forums, so I expect
iot should be here within two to three weeks, maybe a little longer. Also it
comes with a european plug, not a Irish/British one, which is a bit of a
disappointment that I will have to root out the screwdriver to make it fit!!!</p></p>

                <p><p>I recently travelled to Munich, Germany on a recent exchange (1st-9th Feb,
2006). Not knowing what to expect, I found a very different Germany from the
text book one you read about (Bavarian Trad Dress, Beer-drinking, Pretzel
Eating, Sausage loving etc!). Of course all of these elements were present, but
I think a modern German society closely reflects American one, in a lot of ways.
Germans are the largest group by ethnicity in United States, so maybe its just
German culture prevalent in America?</p></p>
