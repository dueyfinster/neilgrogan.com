                <p><p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the shell and the productivity it brings, you can have a text
editor, command to run a server and more within easy reach. I use a shell at
work, at home and on the go. On the go could be using my iPad or iPhone. One of
the first SSH clients on iOS was iSSH, which I used many years ago. After this,
Panic released a professional class application called <a href="https://panic.com/prompt/">Prompt</a>. Prompt is
what I&rsquo;ve happily used for the last few years, but the 10 minute background
process limit is a constant pain. Just a quick switch away for a few minutes,
and you have to reconnect. That&rsquo;s fine once or twice, but when it happens many
times it seriously slows your productivity.</p></p>

                <p><p>For the last few years, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to budget properly and see where my money was going. But like all habits that are good for you, looking after your finances takes time, care and attention. I started off by researching the market for budgeting software. A lot of the prepackged software out there was very US-centric, including Quicken, Microsoft Money and <a href="https://www.mint.com">Mint.com</a>. I eventually settled on and bought a license for <a href="https://www.ynab.com">You Need a Budget</a>, because: it had a budgeting methodology, very good Euro support and was cross platform with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR">Adobe Air</a>. YNAB lasted me well for a few years, with its pretty graphs and ease of expense entry. I even liked their much pared-down companion iOS app at the time.</p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the ultimate work computer in many ways, always with you, light enough and comfortable enough for real work™. The keyboard shortcuts in iOS have improved massively from iOS 8 to iOS 9 to the point of actually being useful and the split screen view is actually rather nice to use (I never &ldquo;got&rdquo; it on a Mac).</p></p>

This book is really a case study in why the future of work will be remote, of which the book did convince me (but I would say, I already believed).</p>
<p><img src="../../img/16/remote-book.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The book is really structured to convince those who do not believe in the premise of the title. It talks about many successful companies who have transformed themselves to work remotely fully and large corporations who save lots of money on office space (IBM, being one example).</p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>Early last year, I purchased two <a href="http://codekeyboards.com">Code Keyboards</a> (one for work and one for home). The Code Keyboards are designed by <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com">Jeff Atwood</a> (who founded <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>). Mechanical keyboards are “old style” in that the switches are from an era where everything was mechanical, unlike today where everything is glass. So mechanical keyboards have ardent fans and people who don’t really care for them.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/16/code_kb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I did a lot of research before I purchased, talking to various people in work who are very knowledgeable about mechanical keyboards (The best community for advice, discussion and group buys is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards">/r/mechanicalkeyboards</a> on reddit.). The variety of hardware and opinions is positively mind melting. If you are doing your own research, you should definitely come across <a href="http://cherryswitches.com">Cherry switches</a> (a very established German brand). Switches are what sit between your key that you see (with the letter printed on top) and the electronic board that converts the key press to a signal the computer can understand.</p></p>

My first impression was how expensive it was priced and what really makes a <em>premium writing application</em>?</p>
<p>Needless to say, I&rsquo;m not a huge writer. But I do have a real fondness for plain text (it will survive the apocalypse) and by extension, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown by John Gruber.</a> The problem for Ulysses is this: there&rsquo;s lots of really great Markdown applications for iOS, two of which I have written about: Editorial (my favourite) and Byword (not so keen on this app).</p></p>

been delighted with the result so far, it lives up to the promises of being
super light but yet durable and strong. Here&rsquo;s a photo of it:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/16/roost.png" alt="Roost Laptop stand holding a macbook" title="Roost Stand"></p>
<p>It came with a really nice case which holds the Roost underneath and has pockets
for a portable keyboard (I use a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/illuminated-keyboard-for-mac-ipad-iphone">Logitech
K811</a>)
and mouse (I use a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/marathon-mouse-m705">Logitech Marathon

great for a really comfortable and ergonomic desk wherever you may travel (or
set up to work). Highly recommended!</p></p>

Software</a> (Java Edition). It provides good insight as to what to look for to create maintainability in enterpise software systems.</p>
<h2 id="10-suggestions-the-book-provides">10 suggestions the book provides:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write shorter units</li>
<li>Write simpler units (measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">Cyclomatic Complexity</a>)</li>
<li>Write code once only</li>
<li>Keep interfaces very small</li>
<li>Seperate code in to modules</li>
<li>Couple modules loosely</li>
<li>Keep modules evenly sized</li>
<li>Keep codebase small (and look for ways to right-size)</li>
<li>Automate development pipeline and your tests</li>
<li>Write clean code and refactor as you go</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall I thought the book was very well laid out, easy to read and easy to understand. I&rsquo;d recommend it to anyone new to software development, but most of the tips contained within the book should be very familiar to the seasoned developer.</p></p>

<p>It can sync via iCloud or the Junecloud cloud service by the makers of the app, Junecloud (not confusing at all, hey!). It started on the Mac as a simple dashboard widget (for those of you who remember those, rarely used these days), but it&rsquo;s since grown to have <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ie/app/deliveries-a-package-tracker/id924726344?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4PJ">its own Mac app also</a>.

When I shopped around at the time, I read that the internals of this machine are just as good as the ones that DeLonghi sells that are twice as expensive. Mostly the price difference comes down to the &ldquo;extraneous&rdquo; features. Where this machine falls down is in a few areas:</p></p>

If your a talk radio fan like me, you&rsquo;ll really appreciate this app! Ever since I switched from an iPhone 4 to a Galaxy S3 and stopped using Apple&rsquo;s Podcast application it has been frustrating to keep up to date with podcasts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used BeyondPod on Android (which I&rsquo;ve praised before - excellent Google Reader integration). I then tried to search for a third party podcast application on the iPad that would synchronise with Google Reader. First there were none, then some (like Feedler and Instacast) but all have been bitterly disappointing with Google Reader integration. Instacast could import OPML (after a messy bundling of feeds in Google Reader) and Feedler could read the feeds (but not handle the video and audio contained within the feed item properly). To be honest I&rsquo;d given up hope, I said to myself I&rsquo;d chalk it up to fate and just buy a Nexus tablet when the iPad 2 was no longer serviceable. But - happily - I was wrong and had been looking in the wrong places&hellip;</p></p>

                <p><p>I recently finished reading Steve Jobs, the biography by Walter Isaacson.
I can&rsquo;t add much more then the extensive coverage that it has recieved in the
press to date. Instead I paraphrase really badly a friend of mine, Noel Hudson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that book thought me was dropping acid and treating people really badly works as a life strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While that&rsquo;s not entirely true it is a humourous look at the books tone.
It has a grain of truth, Walter Issacson really focuses on the warts and
all representation of Steve Jobs. He defines him very much in terms of how
other people percieved him, whether that should have been the mainstay of
the book is up for debate. Overall it&rsquo;s a good book, what I liked most is
the history lessons of the creation of the mac and how the Disney/Pixar
relationship went down before the merger. I also felt Walter Issacson
left it hanging at the end and that he knows much more that he can&rsquo;t
publish due to Apple&rsquo;s corporate strategy being tied to Jobs so much
(like the comment he made about cracking the UI for a TV).</p></p>

            </h2>
            <div>
                <p><p>I recently bought the wifi version of the Motorola Xoom. I did not get the 3G version to
keep costs down (no second carrier subscription in addition to smartphone I own). Here&rsquo;s
my review, let it be noted I&rsquo;ve been an iOS user since version 2 (iPhone 3G) and although
I have used devices from Android 1.6 and up - I&rsquo;ve never &rsquo;lived&rsquo; with them.</p>

<h2 id="aesthetics--design">Aesthetics &amp; Design</h2>
<p>First of all the design is very well executed. It looks and feels like a premium tablet
should (should that be iPad competitor?). The ports are a clear winner and still are over
any other tablet. I haven&rsquo;t got the video dock yet, but I ampositiveit&rsquo;ll be
a great addition to my big HDTV. The only gripe really is that it doesn&rsquo;t charge through
usb, which I believe is because it has two batteries. It charges through supplied plug
insanely fast! It lasts all day and then some with heavy use also. I haven&rsquo;t left the
thing alone long enough to test the standby time, but I am sure it&rsquo;s good also. The 10.1&quot;
screen feels like the &lsquo;right&rsquo; size for a tablet and I&rsquo;ll besurprisedif more
tablets don&rsquo;t end up adopting a screen size closer to the Xoom&rsquo;s. The heft is a bit much,
I would like it to be a small bit lighter - but nearly all tablets with proper glass
screens will be heavy.</p></p>

Those of you who come here often know <a href="http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/03/review.html">I reviewed Sennheiser HD595 before</a>,
which is a headset built for the quality of reproduction (I use that one for music).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much you can say about a VOIP headset, so I am going to keep this short!
The Plantronics .655 USB isn&rsquo;t the most comfortable headset and the usb connection
seemed like a plus as I&rsquo;d never owned a USB headset. The mic quality is a lot better
with the USB connection (though I am guessing 90% is down to the fact it&rsquo;s directional
and pointed at your mouth), but the sound won&rsquo;t be.</p></p>

have bought instead. Strange place for a review; but its good to see

                <p><p>Recently I downloaded the <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a> packages of
the new <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 4.2 beta 2. For those of you who
don&rsquo;t know; KDE is the <a href="http://www.kde.org/">K Desktop Environment</a>;
which includes a window manager
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwin">KWin</a>), common desktop
applications, its own menu
(<a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html">Kickoff</a>),
browser (<a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a>), file manager
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_(software)">dolphin</a>) etc.
Basically it is the most popular desktop environment on Linux next to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME">Gnome</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>**What is so special about KDE? **<br>
The philosophy of KDE is the advanced configuration it allows through
its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI">Graphical User Interface</a> (GUI),
this is versus <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> which chooses sane
defaults and leaves configuration in hard to reach places and
out-of-sight. This isn&rsquo;t to say KDE doesn&rsquo;t choose sane defaults; it
does and is very user-friendly. KDE has always been the more
Windows-like of the major desktop environments and this hasn&rsquo;t really
changed in KDE 4.X series. KDE is available in popular distributions of
Linux such as Kubuntu, <a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva</a>,
<a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/">OpenSuse</a>. The special part about 4.X
series is that for the first time for any Linux desktop environment; it
is fully cross-platform, easily installs and works on Microsoft Windows
and Apple Mac OS X.</p></p>

are for people that don&rsquo;t know how to avoid them! Not only do they stop

fix to everyone online within hours. It is definately my favourite
extension! I don&rsquo;t block certain ads like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft (the

good websites I frequent make a living. But for all the rest trying to

                <p><p>Well I
think so! Got one there 2 months ago and forgot to write a blog post
about it. I got a &lsquo;01 model for a bargain price I believe; but this
theory has yet to be tested (I&rsquo;ll wait for a year to be up). As I
mentioned before in previous posts my parent&rsquo;s house is now in a remote
location with no train/buses anywhere nearby. So transport was
essential! At this time also there was a major crack down on learner
drivers not being accompanied by a fully licensed driver (of two years).
So by the time I&rsquo;d saved the money for the car; got 10 lessons and
convinced anyone I knew with over two years full driving experience to
accompany me; even to work - was just to much hassle - hence the moped
which has no such onerous requirements. In fact only one it does really
have is that you can&rsquo;t have passengers - I won&rsquo;t be carrying anyone
anyways - so I am not too bothered. Anyhoo take a look at the photos I
took when I got it. I have done it up since then: new tyres, resprayed
exhaust, full service; new mirrors; repaired exhaust; flushed out
radiator and put in proper coolant just to name a few. So it sounds
allot better and drives better than ever!</p></p>

soon. I certainly don&rsquo;t envy the position of a small team getting the
hardware and software for a mini-computer right in such a short space of

right than the N770 which I thought had the best design of all (be it
functionality not so much style). The N810 has bags of style; in a
flashy brand-new-car sort of way; it looks expensive and I believe Nokia
plays to this in their pricing.</p></p>

announced an upgrade to the N800 Internet tablet, called the N810. I
suspect its called that because it is more of an incremental upgrade
than a total visual refresh it was going from an Nokia 770 to N800. Here
it is:</p>

<p>(Picture Courtesy: <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/10/17/the-nokia-n810-internet-tablet/">Internet Tablet
Talk</a>)</p>
<p>It sports a nice new hardware keyboard; inbuilt GPS (For satellite
mapping) and OS 2008 (an upgrade to the operating system it runs). The
N800 will also benefit from OS 2008, which will include GoogleTalk,
Skype, Mozilla browser, among the usual such as its email client, media
player, file manager, control panel, assorted games and an image/PDF
viewer. The one feature it will emit is an inbuilt FM Radio, which was
axed to make the N810 a smaller tablet. It still retains the best screen
size for web browsing, bluetooth connectivity, and of course Wifi which
is central to the tablets existance! No word on what easter eggs are
included if any; on the N800 it was a radio and the N770 it was the
microphone. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/17/nokia-n810-hands-on/">Engadget has a great writeup on

Ubuntu Book (2nd Edition) is a nicely put together book for dealing with

<li>Using Ubuntu on the Desktop</li>
<li>Advanced Usage and Managing Ubuntu</li>
<li>Ubuntu Server</li>

<li>Ubuntu-Related Projects</li>
<li>Using Edubuntu</li>

<p>This book is a very complete introduction and contains suprising
elements related to finding out and joining the community of users -
which you will not find in other Ubuntu Books (such as O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Ubuntu
Hacks) which make it a unique and worthwhile addition to any Ubuntu
users personal library. It is most helpful to new users to Ubuntu, which
sections on installing and help with problems that could be faced.
Having said that, it falls short on the amount of truly unique
information that it contains - most of the books contents can be found
on the web. What you are paying for is a well-laid out, well written
account of the Ubuntu-sphere and all that goes along with it.</p></p>

Hewlett-Packard. While I had seen and briefly used one before, I was
excited again upon using my own one (as all tech people are [read:
geeks]). First of all don&rsquo;t confuse me as anyway into photography: I&rsquo;m
not and far from it. I had a criteria in mind when I purchased and this
was it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must work under any OS (Windows [a given], Mac and Linux [latter two
I only use])</li>
</ul>
<p>Every camera I have come across mounts as a disc drive [think looking at
files on a cd or your local computer], but there is also PTP or &ldquo;Picture
Transfer Protocol&rdquo; in other words it doesn&rsquo;t appear as picture files,
rather PTP triggers your computer to open your camera in your photo
application. I was unsure if this PTP would work under Mac or Linux,
since I had only briefly seen it as an option in
<a href="http://www.digikam.org/">digiKam</a>. It turns out on Mac there is <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/imagecapture/">Image
Capture</a>, and Ubuntu
(My Linux distribution of choice) it automatically detects it and asks
to import photos into<a href="http://f-spot.org/">F-Spot</a>.</p></p>

well, or is very difficult to install. “Dependency Hell” (When software relies

cleaned a lot of dependency hell up, and a new program for installing software
from the internet, is included in the new version, due to be released 1st June
2006.</p>
<p>That’s when I discovered a little gem called <a href="http://klik.atekon.de/" title="Klik it!">Klik</a> for many Linux
distributions. Simply lookup the piece of software you need, click on it and
you have it! No need to install! It places the whole program on the desktop,
so it is easily deletable and easily transferable. For example, if you have an
office application, and your friend doesn’t, simply copy that file on desktop
to your usb key or a cd, and copy to friends pc, done and dusted - Your friend
has the whole application! This is an obvious feature bonus over current
Windows version, XP.</p></p>

                <p><p>I got it! UPS delivered the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet. What can I say? It is
pure magic! The features are great, it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Browser (Opera)</li>
<li>Flash Player version 6</li>
<li>Email Client</li>
<li>Internet Radio</li>
<li>News Reader</li>
<li>Media players, Image viewer</li>
<li>PDF viewer</li>
<li>File Manager</li>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Calculator</li>
<li>World Clock</li>
<li>Notes</li>
<li>Sketch</li>
<li>Games</li>
</ul>
<p>It runs on Linux, making it totally extendable. It even has its own developer
site at maemo.org, where applications can be downloaded. Hot  on my list were
Doom (the Game) and GAIM (Instant Messenger, uses Google Talk, AOL, MSN,
Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, etc). Unfortunately their is no Skype for Nokia 770 just
yet, but hopefully it will be here soon. Nokia has promised an upgrade in
2006, that will include VOIP, such as skype.</p></p>
