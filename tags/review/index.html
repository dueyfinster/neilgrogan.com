I use a shell at work, at home and on the go. On the go could be using my iPad or iPhone. One of the first SSH clients on iOS was iSSH, which I used many years ago.

But like all habits that are good for you, looking after your finances takes time, care and attention. I started off by researching the market for budgeting software. A lot of the prepackged software out there was very US-centric, including Quicken, Microsoft Money and Mint.com. I eventually settled on and bought a license for You Need a Budget, because: it had a budgeting methodology, very good Euro support and was cross platform with Adobe Air.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 10, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../ipadpro/>iPad Pro Review</a></h2><div><p>After some thought initially on a new laptop, I decided to spring for an iPad Pro 12.9". So far I am really glad I did, the computer comes with me everywhere. I bring it to work, to visit family, on trips and everywhere in between.
It&rsquo;s the ultimate work computer in many ways, always with you, light enough and comfortable enough for real work™. The keyboard shortcuts in iOS have improved massively from iOS 8 to iOS 9 to the point of actually being useful and the split screen view is actually rather nice to use (I never &ldquo;got&rdquo; it on a Mac).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 13, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../remote-book/>Remote: Office Not Required</a></h2><div><p>I recently read Remote: Office Not Required by David Heinemeier-Hansson (who created Ruby on Rails) and Jason Fried (who co-founded 37 Signals with Heinemeier-Hansson). This book is really a case study in why the future of work will be remote, of which the book did convince me (but I would say, I already believed).
The book is really structured to convince those who do not believe in the premise of the title.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 1, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../mech-kb/>Mechanical Keyboards</a></h2><div><p>Early last year, I purchased two Code Keyboards (one for work and one for home). The Code Keyboards are designed by Jeff Atwood (who founded Stack Overflow). Mechanical keyboards are “old style” in that the switches are from an era where everything was mechanical, unlike today where everything is glass. So mechanical keyboards have ardent fans and people who don’t really care for them.
I did a lot of research before I purchased, talking to various people in work who are very knowledgeable about mechanical keyboards (The best community for advice, discussion and group buys is /r/mechanicalkeyboards on reddit.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 15, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../ulysses-app/>Ulysses App</a></h2><div><p>I recently purchased Ulysses Mobile after a recommendation from Macstories. My first impression was how expensive it was priced and what really makes a premium writing application?
Needless to say, I&rsquo;m not a huge writer. But I do have a real fondness for plain text (it will survive the apocalypse) and by extension, Markdown by John Gruber. The problem for Ulysses is this: there&rsquo;s lots of really great Markdown applications for iOS, two of which I have written about: Editorial (my favourite) and Byword (not so keen on this app).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 1, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../roost-stand/>Roost Laptop Stand</a></h2><div><p>I backed the Roost laptop stand on Kickstarter, which already had a successful run in their first Kickstarter campaign. I&rsquo;ve been delighted with the result so far, it lives up to the promises of being super light but yet durable and strong. Here&rsquo;s a photo of it:
It came with a really nice case which holds the Roost underneath and has pockets for a portable keyboard (I use a Logitech K811) and mouse (I use a Logitech Marathon M705).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 15, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../maintain-soft-book/>Maintainable Software Book</a></h2><div><p>I recently read O&rsquo;Reilly Building Maintainable Software (Java Edition). It provides good insight as to what to look for to create maintainability in enterpise software systems.
10 suggestions the book provides: Write shorter units Write simpler units (measured in Cyclomatic Complexity) Write code once only Keep interfaces very small Seperate code in to modules Couple modules loosely Keep modules evenly sized Keep codebase small (and look for ways to right-size) Automate development pipeline and your tests Write clean code and refactor as you go Overall I thought the book was very well laid out, easy to read and easy to understand.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 1, 2016</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../deliveries-app/>Deliveries App</a></h2><div><p>Deliveries helps you track packages from major shopping (Amazon, Apple) as well as nearly every major package distribution company like DHL, UPS and FedEx. I&rsquo;ve used the app for years and it&rsquo;s really impressed me.
It can sync via iCloud or the Junecloud cloud service by the makers of the app, Junecloud (not confusing at all, hey!). It started on the Mac as a simple dashboard widget (for those of you who remember those, rarely used these days), but it&rsquo;s since grown to have its own Mac app also.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>December 1, 2015</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../editorial-app/>Editorial App</a></h2><div><p>Editorial is an iPhone and iPad plain text editor that&rsquo;s great for markdown1. It also has some nifty automation workflows, in which you can use Python scripts. These can search the web, scrape data, transform text and much more…
I pretty much wrote this blog post (and many more) in Editorial. It&rsquo;s much better then the competition for markdown in particular. Byword is an obvious competitor, which I really can&rsquo;t recommend (nothing inherently wrong with Byword, just doesn&rsquo;t suit me).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 10, 2015</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../soulver-app/>Soulver App</a></h2><div><p>My favourite text number crunching app on iOS bar none is Soulver.

Fast to load Simple user interface that gets out of the way Contextual Keyboards (my favourite is the currency keyboard) Can reuse calculations from previous lines (and name calculations). iCloud sync Soulver is great for when a spreadsheet is just to heavy. I use it a lot for it currency conversion, makes it easy to have multiple line items in different currencies (say GBP & USD) and get a total in one (EUR).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 17, 2014</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../drafts-app/>Drafts App</a></h2><div><p>My favourite text capture app on iOS bar none is Drafts by Agile Tortoise.

No fluff, loads fast Simple user interface that gets out of the way Extensible actions (which you can add to from their directory) iCloud sync I&rsquo;ve tried a lot of other apps like Byword (Not worth the money I think), Apples' built-in Notes app, Textastic and so on.

It was the best rated coffee machine (at time of purchase) on Amazon and it doesn&rsquo;t dissapoint. For the purpose, it&rsquo;s wonderful:
Make great coffee fast, without a mess.
If you&rsquo;re looking for more, I would have a look at the more expensive models. When I shopped around at the time, I read that the internals of this machine are just as good as the ones that DeLonghi sells that are twice as expensive.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 13, 2014</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../stitcher/>Stitcher is (audio) podcasts done right</a></h2><div><p>Just a quick post about a great application I&rsquo;ve seen mentioned by Cali Lewis: Stitcher.

Ever since I switched from an iPhone 4 to a Galaxy S3 and stopped using Apple&rsquo;s Podcast application it has been frustrating to keep up to date with podcasts.

Here&rsquo;s my review, let it be noted I&rsquo;ve been an iOS user since version 2 (iPhone 3G) and although I have used devices from Android 1.6 and up - I&rsquo;ve never &lsquo;lived&rsquo; with them.

Those of you who come here often know I reviewed Sennheiser HD595 before, which is a headset built for the quality of reproduction (I use that one for music).
There&rsquo;s not much you can say about a VOIP headset, so I am going to keep this short!

Firstly I should mention, I&rsquo;ve never owned another Garmin unit, and had two mobile GPS' units before (one being Nokia N800 with Bluetooth external GPS and other Apple iPhone 3G).
