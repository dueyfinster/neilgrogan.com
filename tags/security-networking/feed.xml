We&amp;rsquo;ve had full body scanners at airports, marshalls on flights, bombs hidden in toner cartridges and two wars. I reflected on this and remembered two really good articles I&amp;rsquo;ll share here on the topic. Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ve changed for the better.
Yesterday I finally wrote something that&amp;rsquo;s been bothering me for about ten years: The fact that Al Qaeda can&amp;rsquo;t be as big and bad as it&amp;rsquo;s made out to be, because its whole design violates every rule of guerrilla organisation.</description></item></channel></rss>
