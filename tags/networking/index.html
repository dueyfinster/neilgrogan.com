It's preserved here as written for those who still have older versions. This post uses a file called gateway.config.json and Unifi now say:
This article is not applicable to the UniFi Dream Machine models, because all configurations are already available in the UniFi Network user interface.
So I take that to mean use of this file is depracated and it should be possible to do this via the administration webpage.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 22, 2020</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../vagrant-ubuntu-fossa/>Ubuntu 20.04 Vagrant with Packer</a></h2><div><p>Ubuntu have recently released the new 20.04 LTS codenamed &ldquo;Focal Fossa&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d also recently seen a tool that piqued my interest, Hashicorp Packer. Packer builds machine images that can be deployed to a cloud or as a virtual machine, or just even a plain disk image. You can even generate many images at once, really simplfying deployment. Very handy if you wanted to create virtual machines for a cluster for example, with a similar but slightly different configuration.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 2, 2020</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../ubnt/>Ubiquiti Home Network</a></h2><div><p>Over the summer, I upgraded my home network to Ubiquiti gear. Ubiquiti do business Wifi, all the way up to covering stadiums. I first heard about them from Troy Hunt and then again from Marco Arment on Accidental Tech Podcast. Ubiquiti are popular in prosumer space - for people serious about good Wifi.
So far it&rsquo;s been an excellent experience and I&rsquo;d highly recommend it. After setting it up (there is a few moving pieces) it has been running without any intervention from me.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 10, 2019</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../irish-sopa-law-an-overview/>Irish SOPA Law: An Overview</a></h2><div><p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 25, 2012</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../nerf-war/>Reflection on 9-11</a></h2><div><p>It&rsquo;s been 10 years since the anniversary of 9/11 and much of the world has changed a lot in that period. We&rsquo;ve had full body scanners at airports, marshalls on flights, bombs hidden in toner cartridges and two wars. I reflected on this and remembered two really good articles I&rsquo;ll share here on the topic. Hopefully we&rsquo;ve changed for the better.
Yesterday I finally wrote something that&rsquo;s been bothering me for about ten years: The fact that Al Qaeda can&rsquo;t be as big and bad as it&rsquo;s made out to be, because its whole design violates every rule of guerrilla organisation.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 12, 2011</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../thoughts-on-ipv6/>Thoughts on IPv6</a></h2><div><p>A multitude of websites have been reporting the impending doom of ipv4 exhaustion, which is going to happen soon. All the top level address&rsquo; will be gone, but the regional registries will still have stocks of address&rsquo; in to 2011.

Below is a very good video which one of my favourite tech shows, Hak5 made with an IPv6 Consultant, Joe Klein.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 9, 2011</time></div></article></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><script src=../../js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
