      <description>Update 2023: these instructions are out-of-date for the latest Unifi controller software versions. It&amp;#39;s preserved here as written for those who still have older versions. This post uses a file called gateway.config.json and Unifi now say:&#xA;This article is not applicable to the UniFi Dream Machine models, because all configurations are already available in the UniFi Network user interface.&#xA;So I take that to mean use of this file is deprecated and it should be possible to do this via the administration webpage.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 10 years since the anniversary of 9/11 and much of the world has changed a lot in that period. We&amp;rsquo;ve had full body scanners at airports, marshalls on flights, bombs hidden in toner cartridges and two wars. I reflected on this and remembered two really good articles I&amp;rsquo;ll share here on the topic. Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ve changed for the better.&#xA;Yesterday I finally wrote something that&amp;rsquo;s been bothering me for about ten years: The fact that Al Qaeda can&amp;rsquo;t be as big and bad as it&amp;rsquo;s made out to be, because its whole design violates every rule of guerrilla organisation.</description>

      <description>A multitude of websites have been reporting the impending doom of ipv4 exhaustion, which is going to happen soon. All the top level address&amp;rsquo; will be gone, but the regional registries will still have stocks of address&amp;rsquo; in to 2011. As a user of ipv6, I thought I could share sone thoughts/insights on the events ahead&amp;hellip;&#xA;Below is a very good video which one of my favourite tech shows, Hak5 made with an IPv6 Consultant, Joe Klein.</description>
