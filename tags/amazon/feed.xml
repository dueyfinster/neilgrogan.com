I have read several books I otherwise would have not read. What I don&amp;rsquo;t get is why otherwise well-healed and technology literate folk dismiss the Kindle out-of-hand. The most common reason? It&amp;rsquo;s not dead-tree paper. You can&amp;rsquo;t hold it. You can&amp;rsquo;t feel it. Yet the biggest thing they dismiss is me. It&amp;rsquo;s personal. I have an eye condition which means I wear hard plastic contacts all day long - my eyes get very tired, very easily.</description></item></channel></rss>
