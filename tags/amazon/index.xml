Amazon.com / Amazon.co.uk - usually buy electronics here! Apple&amp;rsquo;s App Store - I use iOS &amp;amp; Mac heavily, buy a lot of apps! Dropbox - sync files across computers Evernote - I store a lot of notes here. Fastmail - My email, contacts, calendars Hover - great place for domain names (like this one). Lastpass - excellent password manager Newsblur - Personalized RSS for news junkies Pinboard - stores all my bookmarks (also archives the sites) Trello - I&amp;rsquo;m planning a holiday via Trello Some of these are referral links, I stand to get extra credit on these services if you use it.</description></item><item><title>Don't get a Kindle</title><link>/dont-get-a-kindle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dont-get-a-kindle/</guid><description>The headline is misleading - I actually love my Kindle. I have read several books I otherwise would have not read. What I don&amp;rsquo;t get is why otherwise well-healed and technology literate folk dismiss the Kindle out-of-hand. The most common reason? It&amp;rsquo;s not dead-tree paper. You can&amp;rsquo;t hold it. You can&amp;rsquo;t feel it. Yet the biggest thing they dismiss is me. It&amp;rsquo;s personal. I have an eye condition which means I wear hard plastic contacts all day long - my eyes get very tired, very easily.</description></item></channel></rss>
