I know I write mainly technology articles, but I thought a departure was warranted from the usual faire.
My main takeaway from having it done is twofold: it&amp;rsquo;s not as bad as you think and it&amp;rsquo;s as bad as you think.

Keratoconus (from Greek: kerato- horn, cornea; and konos cone), is a degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye in which structural changes within the cornea cause it to thin and change to a more conical shape than its normal gradual curve.</description></item></channel></rss>
