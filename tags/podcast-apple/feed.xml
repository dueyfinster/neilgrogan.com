A recent episode covered Haiku - an open source operating system based on the design of the old BeOS. What&amp;rsquo;s very interesting about BeOS is the design, an integrated all in one operating system - and the fact Apple almost purchased it. That&amp;rsquo;s amazing to me, literally in one fell swoop, if Apple had of offered the 200 million Be Systems wanted, there would be no NextStep into Apple and by extension - Steve Jobs.</description></item></channel></rss>
