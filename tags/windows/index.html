I
just tried Herd 5 of Gutsy Gibbon, a beta release which will be Ubuntu 07.10
released in October. Obviously it is still early stages and a lot of things
aren&rsquo;t working quite as they should, but it looks very promising. Here&rsquo;s some
new stuff which should hit the final release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiz Fusion - Pretty Graphics that leave you in awe&hellip;</li>
<li>Bullet Proof X - Making sure you&rsquo;ll never see a terminal prompt not of your
own choosing, basically the graphics server should be &lsquo;bulletproof&rsquo;</li>
<li>Appearance Manager - Making it easier to change yourbuntu&rsquo;s look and feel</li>
<li>Better Driver Support - More of those restricted drivers to make sure you can
see your screen and use your wifi card</li>
<li>Simplified Codecs install - It will now be painless, install
ubuntu-restrictedcodecs (or kubuntu-restricted codecs) and you can see Youtube
in all its glory, play a dvd, watch that porno WMV file (just kidding but I
think thats all WMV is used for) and other such niceties of the propreitry
world we have to put up with</li>
<li>Firefox Codecs Plugin - Firefox will be hooked up to the package manager and
prompt to install Flash/Java if you haven&rsquo;t got it already, much the same way
it prompts to get a codec when you throw a file at it that it cannot play in
the movie player. The free software Gnash replacement for Flash will come as
standard and can play Youtube Vids.</li>
<li>Dual Screen Glory - If your like me you have a nice and small portable laptop,
but that screen just won&rsquo;t do all of the time, thats why I personally have a
19&quot; to plug my 13&quot; MacBook into. With Gutsy I should be able to plug and play
over DVI.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the features that are being worked on for the final
release. Probably not all of them on the list will get into Gutsy final, but
lets hope they do! Gutsy+1 (slated for release April 2008) has been announced as
&ldquo;Hardy Hereon&rdquo; and should be a long term release (5 years server and 3 years
desktop updates and
patches).<a href="http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg" alt="image"></a></p></p>

been always pleased with Dells prices, how their machines work with Linux, their

mail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like a refund of Windows XP since I am installing Ubuntu Linux on the
computer when I get it. When I turn on the computer I am going to decline the
EULA, and I am within my rights to request this refund (as part of Irish

I
recently read a very insightful article on 7 factors every company should
seriously consider about Microsoft Windows, here they are summarised:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Licensing Costs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating systems
and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of money on
licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S. companies
overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software maintenance in 2007.</p></p>

<a href="http://blogs.csoonline.com/exactly_how_biased_am_i">he isn&rsquo;t biased</a>, saying he
worked over 75% of his career outside Microsoft, using Slackware Linux, Unix, HP
Unix etc. He claims Windows Vista has less security holes than popular versions
of Linux, such as Ubuntu (he also compares Red Hat, Novell, Mac OS X). First let
me say why his facts are distorted, and why he knows his facts are distorted.
His facts do raise an issue of slow patching of vulnerabilities across the
software Industry, but Linux performs the best consistently because anyone can
audit the code. Here&rsquo;s why his comparisons are uneven:</p></p>

                <p><p>Hard to believe really, Mr.Gates lists Windows Vista &lsquo;innovations&rsquo;. Now Apple
has been shipping everything he mentions since 2005, and I have tried Vista, it
doesn&rsquo;t even surpass Apples&rsquo; attempt at the software (which should be his aim).
Some things have been around for years, but it&rsquo;s how well your software can do
it is the key. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t tout features that another competitor does
better, but thats just me. It seems irresponsible and unbelieveable the head of
a public company can say and get away with this - not knowing the competition
that is. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust my money to anyone who does not keep up with the
latest and greatest trends in the industry.</p></p>

                <p><p>Well as I write this it is a few days after Vista&rsquo;s launch, and it has yet to
set the software market alight. But this is nothing new, it happend with XP. How
do you convince people the latest and greatest is worth the money? Microsoft is
in a tough position due to stiff competition - old, working, fully-compatible
windows machines don&rsquo;t disappear into thin air. There has been a lot more FUD
(Fear Uncertainty and Doubt)abput Vista already from the Free and Open Source
camp. Some of the harsh critiscims will be justified, others probably not.
Regardless this will not hurt Microsofts marketing whatsoever, the average user
doesn&rsquo;t share concerns over digital restriction/rights management - yet.
Microsoft say it will be on 100m PC&rsquo;s by years end. I don&rsquo;t think it will be as
fast as Microsoft would like, due to: 1) People wait for service packs. 2)
People don&rsquo;t upgrade PC&rsquo;s as fast now. Most things people identify their
computer with is increasingly online, a worrying trend if I were Microsoft, this
creates platform independence for the average user, granted not the gamers, or
other highly specialised software vendors.</p></p>
