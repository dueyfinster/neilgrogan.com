If I use the CLI (or Linux) it&rsquo;ll be Vim, if I&rsquo;m on Mac it&rsquo;ll be Textmate but on Windows it&rsquo;s Notepad++.

Obviously it is still early stages and a lot of things aren&rsquo;t working quite as they should, but it looks very promising. Here&rsquo;s some new stuff which should hit the final release:
Compiz Fusion - Pretty Graphics that leave you in awe&mldr; Bullet Proof X - Making sure you&rsquo;ll never see a terminal prompt not of your own choosing, basically the graphics server should be &lsquo;bulletproof&rsquo; Appearance Manager - Making it easier to change yourbuntu&rsquo;s look and feel Better Driver Support - More of those restricted drivers to make sure you can see your screen and use your wifi card Simplified Codecs install - It will now be painless, install ubuntu-restrictedcodecs (or kubuntu-restricted codecs) and you can see Youtube in all its glory, play a dvd, watch that porno WMV file (just kidding but I think thats all WMV is used for) and other such niceties of the propreitry world we have to put up with Firefox Codecs Plugin - Firefox will be hooked up to the package manager and prompt to install Flash/Java if you haven&rsquo;t got it already, much the same way it prompts to get a codec when you throw a file at it that it cannot play in the movie player.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 29, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../dell-refunds-me-for-windows/>Dell refunds me for Windows!</a></h2><div><p>As many of you know I am a Linux and Mac aficionado. For my Linux machines, all of them are Dell. I have been always pleased with Dells prices, how their machines work with Linux, their customer service and the fact they are made in Limerick, Ireland (I am from Ireland). I politely emailed Dell (well got up on my high horse), heres my first mail:
I would like a refund of Windows XP since I am installing Ubuntu Linux on the computer when I get it.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 21, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../seven-financial-reasons-not-to-use/>Seven financial reasons not to use Windows</a></h2><div><p>I recently read a very insightful article on 7 factors every company should seriously consider about Microsoft Windows, here they are summarised:
Licensing Costs Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating systems and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of money on licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S. companies overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software maintenance in 2007.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 6, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../windows-vista-security-better-than/>Windows Vista Security - Better than Linux?</a></h2><div><p>After reading a nice article written by Jeff Jones, a security researcher for Microsoft. He says he isn&rsquo;t biased, saying he worked over 75% of his career outside Microsoft, using Slackware Linux, Unix, HP Unix etc. He claims Windows Vista has less security holes than popular versions of Linux, such as Ubuntu (he also compares Red Hat, Novell, Mac OS X). First let me say why his facts are distorted, and why he knows his facts are distorted.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 3, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../bill-gates-lists-vista/>Bill Gates lists Vista 'innovations'</a></h2><div><p>Hard to believe really, Mr.Gates lists Windows Vista &lsquo;innovations&rsquo;. Now Apple has been shipping everything he mentions since 2005, and I have tried Vista, it doesn&rsquo;t even surpass Apples&rsquo; attempt at the software (which should be his aim). Some things have been around for years, but it&rsquo;s how well your software can do it is the key. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t tout features that another competitor does better, but thats just me.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 29, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../vista-is-released-ubuntu-gets-exe/>Vista is released; Ubuntu gets .exe!</a></h2><div><p>Well as I write this it is a few days after Vista&rsquo;s launch, and it has yet to set the software market alight. But this is nothing new, it happend with XP. How do you convince people the latest and greatest is worth the money? Microsoft is in a tough position due to stiff competition - old, working, fully-compatible windows machines don&rsquo;t disappear into thin air. There has been a lot more FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt)abput Vista already from the Free and Open Source camp.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 2, 2007</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../linux-vs-windows/>Linux VS. Windows</a></h2><div><p>I use Linux, I also use Windows. I see the merits of the two, as they are different. Most people don’t see this distinction, that although the two OSes do many of the same functions, they remain lightyears apart. I have to admit I preach Linux to the hilt, I shouldn’t, but I do. I get skeptical Windows users who ask me what Linux does better, and I am stuck for an answer, as it does a lot of tasks better.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 6, 2006</time></div></article></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><script src=../../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
