As my former bank PTSB recently raised their fees, I decided to move to KBC. I was excited to see, as part of the open payments directive, they have a nice developer portal. I reached out to KBC&amp;rsquo;s dev team, but alas they are only accepting registered companies, who meet stringent criteria. They told me they hope to open it up soon to end users, I live in hope!</description></item><item><title>Automatic Newsletter Cleanup in Gmail</title><link>/gmail-newsletter-filter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gmail-newsletter-filter/</guid><description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t tried Google Apps Script, I found a really nifty use for it: smart filtering for email. Wait, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I just use Gmails' built-in filters? As it turns out you can&amp;rsquo;t - my filter needs to act on email that matched that filter in the past. So in other words: a filter can only act on email it actually &amp;ldquo;filters&amp;rdquo;, which kinda makes sense! I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of automation (and email is ripe for automation), as you can see from my post on meetings in Outlook.</description></item><item><title>Adventures with React</title><link>/react/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/react/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;d seen a post on Hacker News about a course for the React JavaScript Framework. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with JavaScript, apart from a course in work, which was focused on the language itself and jQuery. React is a front end framework, which allows you to build reusable components (and generate them with data.)
The only real experience I have is writing an application (using Node.js) for my MSc course which was an AJAX application for interacting with Amazon SimpleDB.</description></item><item><title>Full Stack Web Application with Node.js Tutorial</title><link>/web-app-nodejs-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/web-app-nodejs-tutorial/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve followed this tutorial personally, not using Mongo as the database at first. It&amp;rsquo;s clear and to the point and provides just what you need to know to get started. Highly recommended.</description></item></channel></rss>
