                <p>Over the last while I&rsquo;ve been collecting wonderful podcast episodes from the hundreds of hours I&rsquo;ve listened to. I&rsquo;ve even workshopped some of my favourites with colleagues and friends (they all approve!). Luckily a neat service called HuffDuffer allows you to create a personalised feed from episodes spanning any podcast you see fit. All you need is a direct link to the MP3 or indeed any format audio file.
So here it is, my favourite episodes spanning many podcasts.</p>

                <p>Just a quick post about a great application I&rsquo;ve seen mentioned by Cali Lewis: Stitcher. If your a talk radio fan like me, you&rsquo;ll really appreciate this app! Ever since I switched from an iPhone 4 to a Galaxy S3 and stopped using Apple&rsquo;s Podcast application it has been frustrating to keep up to date with podcasts.
I&rsquo;ve used BeyondPod on Android (which I&rsquo;ve praised before - excellent Google Reader integration).</p>

                <p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before1, I regularly watch technology podcasts and I&rsquo;ve had a subscription to sites like Lynda.com. Between those and Youtube, I&rsquo;ve watched an awful lot of technology how-to videos and 90% of them are quite poor in terms of editing, sound and being coherent/properly scripted. Sometimes though it&rsquo;s a joy to genuinely learn something new in a short, concise and to the point video.
This haktip is right up there with being among the best: short, concise, to the point and about a utility that will be super-useful to me.</p>

                <p>I try to listen to as many podcasts (netcasts?) as I can. They fall in to two categories: Irish radio and technology. Luckily, there is so much competition in this space it&rsquo;s hard to pick the best - so quality is high!

            <div>
                <p>I usually listen to podcasts on the excellent Twit.tv network and it goes without saying Floss Weekly is one of my favourites. A recent episode covered Haiku - an open source operating system based on the design of the old BeOS. What&rsquo;s very interesting about BeOS is the design, an integrated all in one operating system - and the fact Apple almost purchased it. That&rsquo;s amazing to me, literally in one fell swoop, if Apple had of offered the 200 million Be Systems wanted, there would be no NextStep into Apple and by extension - Steve Jobs.</p>

                <p>Even while podcasts are relatively new (well a couple of years - like blogs), Irish Radio Stations are surprisingly well in on the act. Even our incumbent state broadcaster, RTE, is podcasting en-masse on both RTE Radio 1 and RTE 2FM. To recieve podcasts, you need podcasting software, start by getting Juice Reciever(Formerly iPodder), available for Linux, BSD, MAC and Windows. I will start with my top 5 Irish Radio podcasts:</p>

I have been watching click online for over a year and a half now, I first saw it on BBC World, while holidaying in Portugal. It also broadcasts on BBC News 24 at 7am on a Sunday morning (I have never seen it at this time!</p>
