hundreds of hours I&rsquo;ve listened to. I&rsquo;ve even workshopped some of my favourites
with colleagues and friends (they all approve!). Luckily a neat service called
<a href="https://huffduffer.com/">HuffDuffer</a> allows you to create a personalised feed
from episodes spanning any podcast you see fit. All you need is a direct link to
the MP3 or indeed any format audio file.</p>
<p>So here it is, my favourite episodes spanning many podcasts. Mostly I love good
stories, with unexpected twists. I suppose you could simplify that to &ldquo;Surprise
and Delight&rdquo;. Be prepared to be entertained, surprised and delighted&hellip;</p></p>

<a href="http://geekbeat.tv/" rel="nofollow">Cali Lewis</a>:
<a href="http://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a>. If your a talk radio fan like
me, you&rsquo;ll really appreciate this app! Ever since I switched from an iPhone 4 to
a Galaxy S3 and stopped using Apple&rsquo;s Podcast application it has been
frustrating to keep up to date with podcasts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used BeyondPod on Android (which I&rsquo;ve praised before - excellent Google
Reader integration). I then tried to search for a third party podcast
application on the iPad that would synchronise with Google Reader. First there
were none, then some (like Feedler and Instacast) but all have been
bitterly disappointing with Google Reader integration. Instacast could
import OPML (after a messy bundling of feeds in Google Reader) and Feedler could
read the feeds (but not handle the video and audio contained within
the feed item properly). To be honest I&rsquo;d given up hope, I said to myself I&rsquo;d
chalk it up to fate and just buy a Nexus tablet when the iPad 2 was no longer
serviceable. But - happily - I was wrong and had been looking in the wrong
places&hellip;</p></p>

                <p><p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I regularly watch technology podcasts and I&rsquo;ve had
a subscription to sites like
<a href="http://www.lynda.com" title="Lynda Training Videos">Lynda.com</a>. Between those and
Youtube, I&rsquo;ve watched an awful lot of technology how-to videos and 90% of them
are quite poor in terms of editing, sound and being coherent/properly scripted.
Sometimes though it&rsquo;s a joy to genuinely learn something new in a short, concise
and to the point video.</p>

<p>This haktip is right up there with being among the best: short, concise, to the
point and about a utility that will be super-useful to me. In work I&rsquo;m in an
agile software development team and I spend a lot of time on the command line. I
<strong>like</strong> the command line, but many don&rsquo;t (personal preference I guess). As part
of being agile, we produce a lot of video demos to stakeholders. Increasingly
though the demos we produce are just as useful for the team - you can&rsquo;t be every
team member at once and this provides huge visibility to the team of progress.
Our software is a Unix product, but we develop on Windows - so Camtasia is
usually used - which is fine for GUI demos. This handy utility will be great to
demo CLI stuff we do.</p></p>

<a href="http://www.twit.tv/floss120">A recent episode</a> covered
<a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/">Haiku</a> - an open source operating system based on the
design of the old BeOS. What&rsquo;s very interesting about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS">BeOS</a> is the design, an integrated all in
one operating system - and the fact Apple almost purchased it. That&rsquo;s amazing to
me, literally in one fell swoop, if Apple had of offered the 200 million Be
Systems wanted, there would be no NextStep into Apple and by extension - Steve
Jobs. It&rsquo;s especially poignant since Apple just surpassed Microsoft to become
the second most valuable American company.</p></p>

first saw it on BBC World, while holidaying in Portugal. It also broadcasts on
BBC News 24 at 7am on a Sunday morning (I have never seen it at this time!).
Although by its nature a technical program, it is very much aimed at the average
