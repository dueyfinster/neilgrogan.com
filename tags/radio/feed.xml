It&amp;rsquo;s not the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a non English speaking country playing all English songs in bars, restaurants and taxis. Rather what was unusual was the very few ads and the fact it was an American station.
I&amp;rsquo;m no fan of ads, and am a huge fan of audio in general - be it spoken word or music.</description></item></channel></rss>
