changed a lot in that period. We&rsquo;ve had full body scanners at airports,
marshalls on flights, bombs hidden in toner cartridges and two wars. I reflected
on this and remembered two really good articles I&rsquo;ll share here on the topic.
Hopefully we&rsquo;ve changed for the better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I finally wrote something that&rsquo;s been bothering me for about ten
years: The fact that Al Qaeda can&rsquo;t be as big and bad as it&rsquo;s made out to be,
because its whole design violates every rule of guerrilla organisation. It&rsquo;s
like a counter intelligence officer&rsquo;s dream, the Al Qaeda plan to bring
guerrillas from all over the world, introduce them to each other, and exchange
funds, material and ideas.</p></p>

the inevitable spyware and viruses found on a Windows machine. Lately I have
been switching people to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, and even getting them
to buy machines to install it on (<a href="http://www.dell.com/open">Dell</a>). But I
understand and have no zealotry for Linux when it comes to fixing peoples&rsquo; real
world problems. I always mention <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> as a matter of
course, and also <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac">Macs</a>. I follow up peoples Ubuntu
installs with friendly emails explaining the free help open to them, but also as
common (probably moreso) are my emailed tips to people guiding them how to fix
there Windows XP computer. So I&rsquo;ll list the steps here which are generic and
should help anyone out their with such problems; this is not a miracle cure and
I fix these problems on a case by case basis, so expect better perfromance, but
not a new computer!!</p></p>

(or The Onion Router) is a service which connects people all over the world with
one aim: privacy. Tor protects from traffic analysis, basically where you have
been. Benn to you Banks website? Feel like buying something off Amazon or Ebay?
Your behaviour online is by no means private, you hand over your numerical
address, browser details, country, city, versions of which plugins you use,
where you came from, just to name a few. You may have seen on sites something to
the effect of &ldquo;Welcome Google user!&rdquo;, that website knows exactly what you typed
to get to it. Tor routes your online activity through different computers, for
example mine went through an educational institution in the US and an Internet
Service Provider in the Netherlands.</p></p>

where has Duey Finsters Web Services gone? It is still here, but me and Thomas
