women get along in male dominated environments, such as Computer
Science. For me it has never mattered someone&rsquo;s gender - I love using,
tweaking and learning about computers and if you share that interest -
the more, the better! It has been shown very young children are
conditioned from a very young age by gender rules - shown by Prof.
Robert Winston in Child of Our Time programme. So I&rsquo;ve often wondered in
a very skewed ratio of males to females (as generally there are more
females than males in society) would affect a Woman&rsquo;s choice of even
considering Computer Science, since so few actually do. So I set about
asking our class representative, <em><strong>Lauren Butler</strong></em>, her thoughts on
Computers, doing Computer Science and being an authority figure in a
male dominated class-room, my questions and her answers follow:</p><p><strong>NG</strong> = Neil Grogan - <strong>LB</strong> = Lauren Butler - <strong>ED</strong> = Editor</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> What first sparked your interest in Computers?</p><p>** LB:** Learning computers in Secondary School, seemed like a cool
thing. But obviously I had been playing computer games for years since
the Sega Mega drive came out so in a way I had probably been into
computers and not really realized.</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> Do you remember the first Computer you got?</p><p><strong>LB:</strong> Some Toshiba piece of heavy brick like crap but it had Windows
XP on it yay, the battery charger connection broke and couldn&rsquo;t power it
anymore so now it&rsquo;s dead and good riddance I say.</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> When did you first realise you&rsquo;d like to do Computer Science? In
School? Or after?</p><p><strong>LB:</strong> Secondary School filling out my CAO application because I
couldn&rsquo;t think of anything else. Guidance councilor said to do arts
(typical response to a person that doesn&rsquo;t know what to do) but I wanted
to be a Garda <em>(ed: a police officer in Ireland)</em> and computers was my
fall back. Long story short the Gard&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t want me after the whole
application process so I went to my plan B&mldr;computers.</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> Would you describe yourself as a Tomboy? You seem to fit the
description of Heterosociality, ie. Preferring (or at least having to)
have more male friends than female.</p><p><strong>LB:</strong> Yes I&rsquo;m a tomboy, obviously it&rsquo;s kinda of weird for a girl to
like computers and computer games. I do have a lot of guy friends and I
do find them easier to get along with but I have a good amount of girl
friends too.</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> Do you remember you first perception of the female to male ratio
of the class in first year (approx 3:40) ?</p><p><strong>LB:</strong> &ldquo;JESUS I Can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m going to have to be in a class with
all boys&mldr;oh wait there&rsquo;s 4 girls over there&rdquo;</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> Did the fact that Computer Science is male dominated influence
your choice negatively or positively?</p><p><strong>LB:</strong> Neither. but I do get on better with boys than I do girls so In
a way it&rsquo;s kind of better for me to be in a male dominated
environment.</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> Do you feel female lecturers have been tougher or easier on you
that you share gender? (ie. Common experiences)</p><p>** LB:** I don&rsquo;t think they have been tougher but I do find they can&rsquo;t
interact with me as well as they do with the males</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> Do you feel male lecturers have been tougher or easier on you
that you differ in gender?</p><p><strong>LB:</strong> No I don&rsquo;t think they have been either but I may get away with
being a bit ditsy at times</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> Do you feel the fact the male to female ratio is skewed will
help or hinder your career prospects?</p><p><strong>LB:</strong> No I don&rsquo;t think it will affect it in any way and it should or
at least I hope it will be based on academics.</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> What would it take to encourage more Women to consider Computer
Science? What would you say to sell it to them as a profession?</p><p><strong>LB:</strong> I honestly don&rsquo;t know but the fact that you can get into
basically any part of the computer industry by doing this course could
be an incentive.</p><p>**NG: **Do you feel any aspect of the course is more male orientated? I
remember one lecturer saying female students excel at coursework, but
this reverses as projects come in later years, which males apparently do
better at?</p><p><strong>LB:</strong> No I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s more male orientated but maybe that
lecturer thinks the more hands on stuff is more male orientated but if
like me who is a tomboy that sort of thing should be more interesting,
i.e fixing computers that&rsquo;s my favorite thing, one of which we don&rsquo;t do
enough of.</p><p><strong>NG:</strong> As Class representative and a leader of the class, do you feel
being a woman has positively impacted the class â€“ i.e. That different
experiences & differing management styles of Women can be a unifying
force?</p><p>**LB: **I really don&rsquo;t think I have had any sort of impact on the class,
I&rsquo;m just a very open person and I&rsquo;d like to think that anyone in the
class could come and class to me.</p><p>**NG: **Do you ever wish people would stop focusing on this male/female
thing and that it all should be a meritocracy? It&rsquo;s it stupid me asking
these questions (have we already moved on?)?</p><p>**LB: **I personally don&rsquo;t see it being focused on the male/female
thing. Especially now being in third year where we are being placed in
groups to work on projects, we all use our talents and abilities to
achieve a good grade. Defiantly in my group I work in I have never had a
problem with my gender being focused on, as long as every one pulls
they&rsquo;re weight who really cares about gender.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/software>#software</a></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><script src=../js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
