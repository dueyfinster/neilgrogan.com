<h1 class="title">Learning Org Mode</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Published on May 20, 2018</p>
</header><p>
Since hearing about <a href="https://orgmode.org">org-mode</a> on the web many
years ago, I always meant to give it a spin. I only ever found one two
problems:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Time - Life eh?</li>
<li>It's a mode of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> for
which I'd also have to learn (again time)</li>
</ol>

<p>
So I recently set about solving both shortcomings, as painful as it was
to dismiss all the effort I put in to my <a href="https://www.vim.org">vim</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory">muscle memory</a> over the
years. The tough part usually is finding good documentation that is both
easy to read and follow.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org94d4dee" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="so-what-is-org-mode">So what is org-mode?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-so-what-is-org-mode">
<p>
To put it simply, Org-mode is an editing mode of Emacs, which allows you
to write plain text TODO lists. But it is also a lot more. You can:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use plain text tables</li>
<li>Run snippets of code (and edit them in their own file with proper
formatting)</li>
<li>Use plain text spreadsheets</li>
<li>Export to many, many formats (Latex, PDF, HTML) or a custom format</li>
<li>Agenda mode for many ways to look at your TODOs</li>
</ul>

<p>
This all sounds complicated, but the beautiful thing about org-mode is
that it gradually reveals the features it has. You can only ever write a
simple list like this if you want:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* My First org mode outline
** TODO Must read the org manual
</pre>

<p>
and that's it. Really. You don't need to use any of the other features
if you don't want to. This is also a reason that it was a joy to learn:
it never pushes unnecessary complication on the user. I wish I could say
the same for Emacs! Although to be fair, Emacs is probably easier then
Vim to get started in.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8479bdb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="combining-emacs-org-literate-programming">Combining Emacs + Org: Literate Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-combining-emacs-org-literate-programming">
<p>
So this was the fun part: how can I combine learning Emacs and Org? It
turns out, I can create my whole Emacs configuration file in org-mode,
and it will convert it Emacs Lisp. This is brilliant because in
org-mode, we can annotate and explain <i>everything</i>. Take a look at this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Packages
  Let's fetch Emacs packages from the Melpa mirror:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
   #+END_SRC
</pre>

<p>
This is fully self documented code (some argue Lisp is this by nature
also). This is nicely rendered on Github, see
<a href="https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.org">these</a>
<a href="https://github.com/seth/my-emacs-dot-d/blob/master/emacs-init.org">two</a>
examples to see what I mean. The pertinent advice here is: start with a
<i>minimal</i> configuration and <i>only ever add things you understand</i>. I
followed exactly this advice, and those two files were brilliant
references. I would find an annoyance in Emacs, and one of those two org
files would have something in Emacs to fix customise the issue I had.
