I recently purchased [Ulysses Mobile](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ie/app/ulysses-mobile/id950335311?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4PJ) after a [recommendation from Macstories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/review-ulysses-2-5-for-ipad-and-now-iphone/). My first impression was how expensive it was priced and what really makes a _premium writing application_?

Needless to say, I'm not a huge writer. But I do have a real fondness for plain text (it will survive the apocalypse) and by extension, [Markdown by John Gruber.](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) The problem for Ulysses is this: there's lots of really great Markdown applications for iOS, two of which I have written about: Editorial (my favourite) and Byword (not so keen on this app).

So where does that leave Ulysses? Well John Voorhees wrote an excellent column in [Club Macstories Newsletter](https://www.macstories.net/club/), where he said you need to exploit a niche on the App Store, but it needs to not be a niche of one (aka. just you). So Ulysses is different to the other applicants I mentioned in key ways:

- All files are called "Sheets" and by default do not need a file name, it is kind of like [Drafts](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ie/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4PJ), just open and write away
- It has a library, all optionally but by default synced to iCloud 
- It has filters, which are flexible way to quickly group "sheets"
- It has extensive tagging 
- It has optional word count targets for each "sheet"
- You can add notes and other metadata which will not show up in the exported result (usually PDF)
- It supports many formats for export, such as docx, PDF, HTML, ePub
- It is very themeable, with an [online web gallery of themes](http://styles.ulyssesapp.com/)

So in other words, it's a lot more extensive in different features and thus audience to the other editors. 

So would I recommend it? I'm still not sure about the _desktop class application_ tag the developers have used, but it is a nice app to write in (I wrote this post on my iPhone in Ulysses). The library and filters seem like something I may not truly need, but there's no doubt it's a nicely designed app. Overall for me it's probably not worth the price tag as I wouldn't use key features, but if your serious about writing, you should definitely pick it up.
