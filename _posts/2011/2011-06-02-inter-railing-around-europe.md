title: Inter-railing around Europe
---

As you read this, I have already embarked on an inter-railing 
trip around Europe. Some of the cities in the itinerary:

* Amsterdam
* Cologne
* NÃ¼rburgring (Rock Am Ring festival)
* Prague
* Bratislava

I'll definitely post up some pictures when I get back. I planned 
this trip with a few classmates to coincide with the completion of 
our four year honours degree in Computer Science.
