title: In Sickness and in Health!
---

I have a throat infection, so I get a week off!! I went to the doctor and I am
on vibramycin antibiotics. I was coughing blood (not nearly as nasty as it
sounds). Now I can get some relaxation in before Christmas!! I hope to do a
guide to restricted formats on Ubuntu soon, especially  W32 Codecs and how to
get all the good formats it offers (Divx, MPEG1-4, Windows Media, Quicktime
Media and RealMedia)

We should all be using free formats, but everyone uses proprietary formats. If
anything makes the transition to Linux that bit smoother, its the ability to
play and view all their media.
