title: Drafts App

My favourite text capture app on iOS bar none is [Drafts][] by Agile Tortoise. What makes it the best?

* No fluff, loads fast 
* Simple user interface that gets out of the way
* Extensible actions (which you can add to from their [directory][])
* iCloud sync

I've tried a lot of other apps like [Byword][] (Not worth the money I think), Apples' built-in Notes app, [Textastic][] and so on. None felt as efficient or as flexible as Drafts. With Drafts, I can trust my text can be anywhere I need it to be.
