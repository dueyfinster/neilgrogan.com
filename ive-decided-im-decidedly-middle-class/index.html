    <div>
        
        <p>
        <p>I had a trip in to the faire capital city of Ireland today:
Dublin. Okay I&rsquo;ll get this out of the way: I had a Frappacino in
Starbucks and I&rsquo;m a student; so not too poor of a student ;)</p>
<p>But I saw the inside of Brown Thomas for the first time. I don&rsquo;t shop
for fashion at all: but what I found was the kind of vulgarity and
fake-ness I&rsquo;d expect of London or New York; not Dublin. To paraphrase
Bono: &ldquo;In America if you have your mansion on a hill people look up to
you and think &lsquo;I want to be like him and afford a house like that one
day&rsquo;; if you have the same mansion in Ireland people say &lsquo;look at the
fucken eejit on the hill with that house; thinks he&rsquo;s god or sumthen&rsquo;&rdquo;
and that to me was always an endearing part of Irish culture; people
around you being the great leveller if you thought you were the bomb.
Inside BT (Brown Thomas) was all the names you&rsquo;d expect; all the major
names more at home in Paris, London or New York. I confronted my friend
who was showing me round about my opinions (in my usual polite manner:
just say it). To my surprise he agreed 110%. Yes he said: for the people
who buy this stuff can tell who else is wearing it; and I think he meant
that by this logic movers and shakers also wore all the brands to look
the part. Soon after he told me he was also learning Golf because he
knew it would be a great benefit for his future career: &ldquo;All important
people also play golf&rdquo; he assured me.</p>
<p>I see this divide in society and I admit it bothers me. Where I go to
College, there is an estate across the road which is by any standards
not had the full benefit of the Celtic Tiger (the Irish Boom Economy). I
get the bus from this place and everytime it bothers me that I see some
social problems: everything from unruly kids trying to ruin the place to
alcholics. But I also have people in my class from that estate: some of
the nicest you&rsquo;d ever care to meet. I&rsquo;ve been asked by them my opinion
on where they live and what do I think other people think.</p>
<p>Then comes my home town. It is on the border of Dublin (city) and
Kildare (farmers and horsebreeders) and we&rsquo;ve got a mix of both. But
Leixlip is decidedly middle class; low enough crime; not much social
tension to be heard of; certainly nowhere near the likes of South Dublin
(seen as upper class) or North Dublin (seen as lower class). Which is
why I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable in either: maybe middle class is the real
stigmata?</p>
