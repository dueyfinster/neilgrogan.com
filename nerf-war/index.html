        <p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s been 10 years since the anniversary of 9/11 and much of the world has
changed a lot in that period. We&rsquo;ve had full body scanners at airports,
marshalls on flights, bombs hidden in toner cartridges and two wars. I reflected
on this and remembered two really good articles I&rsquo;ll share here on the topic.
Hopefully we&rsquo;ve changed for the better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I finally wrote something that&rsquo;s been bothering me for about ten
years: The fact that Al Qaeda can&rsquo;t be as big and bad as it&rsquo;s made out to be,
because its whole design violates every rule of guerrilla organisation. It&rsquo;s
like a counter intelligence officer&rsquo;s dream, the Al Qaeda plan to bring
guerrillas from all over the world, introduce them to each other, and exchange
funds, material and ideas.</p>
<p>It was pure cowardice that kept me from saying that sooner. A good lesson for
me in not listening to the majority. The majority, the media, whatever you
want to call it-maybe &ldquo;the background noise&rdquo; is the best way to describe
it-kept saying that Al Qaeda was the biggest baddest thing in history and even
though I grumbled and held back a little, I bought into that idea way more
than I should, knowing the way I did that everything about their set-up
pointed to a flash in the pan-which is what they&rsquo;ve turned out to be. Back in
2005, when the Al Qaeda hoax was hitting its peak, I wrote a column called
&ldquo;Nerf War and Real War: Al Qaeda vs. IRA.&rdquo; If you want a good quick lesson in
why dummies like me have such a hard time understanding guerrilla warfare,
even when they&rsquo;ve got all the info they need right in front of them, just read
that article. I re-read it yesterday, after a reader pointed out that I&rsquo;d
praised Al Qaeda for going all out and was being inconsisent in yesterday&rsquo;s
blog for saying they blew their assets. - <a href="http://exiledonline.com/wn-38-ira-vs-al-qaeda-i-was-wrong/">WN 38 IRA VS. AL QAEDA: I WAS
WRONG</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the aftermath of the disaster, the sheer demand for information sent news
site after news site crashing down, especially in the US, leaving the world
once more glued to the telly for the up-to-the-minute details of what was
taking place.</p>
<p>The Register did its best. Generally, the site stayed up, and in response to
email requests from Americans who were stuck at work, Reg hacks posted rolling
updates, sourced from TV and radio, as the disaster unfolded.</p>
<p>Ten years on, things have changed. For starters, internet infrastructure is
much more robust. In 2011, the internet still hasn&rsquo;t beaten TV for serving up
breaking news, but it&rsquo;s at least an equal player now, with news organizations
trawling Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and personal blogs to find out what is
happening on the ground.</p>
