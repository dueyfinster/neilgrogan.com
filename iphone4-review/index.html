I have obviously been so quick to review this device, the iPhone 5
is upon us! My philosophy for reviewing items is you <strong>have to live with them</strong>.
Well boy have I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do
marvel at how good the hardware is. I&rsquo;ve dropped this extremely expensive
device on occasions <i>too numerous to count</i>, so luckily it is designed well.</p><h3 id=apps>Apps</h3><p><a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5288/5318056503_a6a2a689df.jpg title="iPhone 4 by marc.flores on flickr"><img src=../files/2011/02/iphone4.jpg class=right alt="iPhone 4"></a>
I have a very large collection of paid apps, two-thirds of which have been
impulse buy, maybe I&rsquo;ll need them someday types. It&rsquo;s a very expensive
platform to get involved with, for sure - but the quality of some apps
has been far better than their desktop counterparts - the one that
springs to mind is Tweetie (now Twitter for iPhone). Some unforgettable
games that take great advantage of the platform have sprung up - my
favourite by far is Cut the Rope. Another is Angry Birds. None of these
or any games I&rsquo;ve played have made really good use of the iPhone 4&rsquo;s
sensors of which there are many - Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Compass,
Camera etc. Sure I&rsquo;ve played driving games but I always feel stupid
using the iPhone as a mock steering wheel. If you&rsquo;re an app junkie like
myself, check out AppAdvice (yes another app) for nice and easy reviews.
I&rsquo;ve also found Lifehacker hive five series for iOS help inform me when
there&rsquo;s a number of popular apps for a platform.</p><h3 id=camera>Camera</h3><p>One of the best features of the iPhone 4 is without a doubt the camera.
It&rsquo;ll obviously never replace anÂ SLR and my compact point and
shoot HP Camera is still better but that&rsquo;s all negated by the ease
of use of iPhone camera. It&rsquo;s with you all the time and has the
best sharing tools (and quick editing tools) of any camera out there.
Great Camera related apps include Flickr, Instagram, Toonpaint and
the included Photos app. I&rsquo;ve shared more photos directly on a one-to-one
basis than ever before, usually after I take the picture with my iPhone -
someone requests it and I mail it or upload to Flickr or Instagram seamlessly.
It&rsquo;s definitely the future of photos, the past was hovering around
a device or printed photos.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>People still are in awe of the iPhone 4 and personally I don&rsquo;t think
that&rsquo;s justified or justifiable any more. Yes its beautiful hardware
and software, but the competition has caught up to Apple. It&rsquo;s still
the best out there as far as I can see, but by that measure it&rsquo;s also
far too expensive. I&rsquo;ve used mine for App development and even still,
as a power user, I think the price is the single biggest turn off.
iPhones do hold their value, which is a relief, should you wish to
switch platforms or upgrade to iPhone 5. So my recommendation? If you
have iPhone lust - buy one - but be ruthless and be willing to sell it
on within 12 months to get something better&mldr; that something is up to
you!</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
