<h1 class="post-title">iPhone 4 Review</h1>
    
    <time>February 18, 2011</time>
    

    <div>
        
        <p>
        <p>I purchased the iPhone 4 shortly after its release in Summer 2010. I have
obviously been so quick to review this device, the iPhone 5 is upon us! My
philosophy for reviewing items is you <strong>have to live with them</strong>. Well boy have
I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do marvel at how good the
hardware is. I&rsquo;ve dropped this extremely expensive device on occasions <i>too
numerous to count</i>, so luckily it is designed well.</p>
<h3 id="apps">Apps</h3>
<p><a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5288/5318056503_a6a2a689df.jpg" title="iPhone 4 by marc.flores on flickr"><img src="../files/2011/02/iphone4.jpg" class="right" alt="iPhone 4"/></a>
I have a very large collection of paid apps, two-thirds of which have been
impulse buy, maybe I&rsquo;ll need them someday types. It&rsquo;s a very expensive platform
to get involved with, for sure - but the quality of some apps has been far
better than their desktop counterparts - the one that springs to mind is Tweetie
(now Twitter for iPhone). Some unforgettable games that take great advantage of
the platform have sprung up - my favourite by far is Cut the Rope. Another is
Angry Birds. None of these or any games I&rsquo;ve played have made really good use of
the iPhone 4&rsquo;s sensors of which there are many - Gyroscope, Accelerometer,
Compass, Camera etc. Sure I&rsquo;ve played driving games but I always feel stupid
using the iPhone as a mock steering wheel. If you&rsquo;re an app junkie like myself,
check out AppAdvice (yes another app) for nice and easy reviews. I&rsquo;ve also found
Lifehacker hive five series for iOS help inform me when there&rsquo;s a number of
popular apps for a platform.</p>
<h3 id="camera">Camera</h3>
<p>One of the best features of the iPhone 4 is without a doubt the camera. It&rsquo;ll
obviously never replace anÂ SLR and my compact point and shoot HP Camera is
still better but that&rsquo;s all negated by the ease of use of iPhone camera. It&rsquo;s
with you all the time and has the best sharing tools (and quick editing tools)
of any camera out there. Great Camera related apps include Flickr, Instagram,
Toonpaint and the included Photos app. I&rsquo;ve shared more photos directly on a
one-to-one basis than ever before, usually after I take the picture with my
iPhone - someone requests it and I mail it or upload to Flickr or Instagram
seamlessly. It&rsquo;s definitely the future of photos, the past was hovering around a
device or printed photos.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>People still are in awe of the iPhone 4 and personally I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s
justified or justifiable any more. Yes its beautiful hardware and software, but
the competition has caught up to Apple. It&rsquo;s still the best out there as far as
I can see, but by that measure it&rsquo;s also far too expensive. I&rsquo;ve used mine for
App development and even still, as a power user, I think the price is the single
biggest turn off. iPhones do hold their value, which is a relief, should you
wish to switch platforms or upgrade to iPhone 5. So my recommendation? If you
have iPhone lust - buy one - but be ruthless and be willing to sell it on within
12 months to get something better&hellip; that something is up to you!</p>
