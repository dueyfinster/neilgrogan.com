&ldquo;rights&rdquo; organizations which pretend to represent the artist have struck gold.
Being able to cajole and bribe the largest Irish Internet Service Provider
(ISP) - Eircom; has worked only too well. Although Eircom has said it will
only obey by having a court order - it has agreed never to oppose these -
which makes it complicit in the act of censorship. My Letter to Our ISP,
Eircom, IRMA, EFF:</p><blockquote><p>Dear [OUR ISP],</p><p>We are a loyal customer of yours. We are writing this because we&rsquo;re
concerned about recent news regarding IRMA (Irish Music Rights Ass.)
relationship with your company (<a href=http://blog.blacknight.com/images/irmaletter.pdf>the recent letters sent
out</a>).</p><p>It would seem that they are seeking to become self-appointed censors
of Irish Internet communications. We do not think that a third-party
company should be permitted to arbitrarily decide which Internet sites
Eircom users; or more importantly any Irish Internet user should be
allowed to visit. Will IRMA want to block sites that merely link to
copyrightable material, proxy sites that circumvent the block, blogs
that criticize its actions? This is a very slippery slope and should
be nipped in the bud.</p><p>In the recent high profile case against The Pirate Bay in Sweden;
IRMA&rsquo;s handlers (IFPI, RIAA) have shown their hand: they don&rsquo;t even
understand the underlying technology. John Kennedy, CEO. IFPI:</p><blockquote><p>Kennedy said he qualified as a lawyer since the 70’s but hasn’t
practiced recently. He was asked if he understood BitTorrent.
Kennedy said he did, but in “very vague terms.” When the defense
lawyers asked more detailed questions, about uTorrent for instance,
Kennedy said he’d heard of it but had no idea of the details. It was
very clear he knew nothing about any remotely technical issues.</p></blockquote><p>This is the the kind of people who wish to regulate the Internet.
Questions need to be asked that if you follow IRMA&rsquo;s requested actions
does this open you up to legal action for any other kinds of material
which rights holders are protective of (Church of Scientology) ? and
can you retain common carrier status like An Post; and need warrants
issued instead of some rights organisation sending you a vague letter
pretending to represent XY&Z ?<br>We understand the &lsquo;concern&rsquo; about Internet piracy. Artists definitely
need to be paid for their hard work. It is an important issue in this
day and age, and it must be addressed correctly. Censorship is not the
answer. It is avoiding the issue. As has always happened in these
cases, it is normal customers who are inconvenienced and have their
free speech restricted the most. We need solutions that work, not
knee-jerk reactions that are doomed to fail. We recommend you read the
EFF’s whitepaper on a better way forward for online music.
<a href=http://www.eff.org/wp/better-way-forward-voluntary-collective-licensing-music-file-sharing>http://www.eff.org/wp/better-way-forward-voluntary-collective-licensing-music-file-sharing</a></p><p>There are opportunities here that are being missed. I think it would
be for the benefit of both artists and music fans if a solution could
be found that combines the technologies developed by the pirates with
a fair system for paying artists.</p><p>**There was a very similar case in Italy where ISPs were forced to
block The Pirate Bay’s website after pressure from the music industry
(the result was that Italian traffic to the site increased by 5%) .
The ban was judged illegal in court under European Directive, 2000/31
CE which is also applicable in Ireland. **</p><p>If this ban goes ahead, Eircom and indeed Ireland will have a
tarnished image on the world stage as a place where misguided efforts
to protect revenue supersede freedom of communication. We would also
be strongly considering abandoning our Internet subscription for an
ISP who doesn&rsquo;t cave to these demands, and we imagine many other
business&rsquo; will too.<br>Please, make the right choice. The world is watching. Your decision
will have an important impact on the future of the Internet in
Ireland.</p><p>Yours faithfully,<br>[Footer]</p></blockquote><p>I will posting more on this issue as it happens. Stay Tuned!</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
