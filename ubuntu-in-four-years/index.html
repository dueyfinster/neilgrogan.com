operating system out there: <a href=http://kernel.org/>Linux</a> and the best distro
<a href=http://www.ubuntu.com/>Ubuntu</a>. Ubuntu was my first foray in to Linux; and I
haven&rsquo;t left it since; although I have tried all the other
major distros. I started with the first version of Ubuntu;
Warthy Warthog:</p><p><img src=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png/180px-Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png alt="Warthy Warthog"></p><p>Warthy had a text only installer and it took me quite a while
to not only get used to the idea of this strange operating
system; but the fear of leaving Windows-land where all that
power usage knowledge would mean nothing. It meant nothing
in terms of the registry and other superficial stuff; but the
more I used Ubuntu and Linux the more I liked it. In fact in
2005 I ditched my XP installation altogether. I noticed there
wasn&rsquo;t an Irish Ubuntu users group; so I mailed one of the
few people (around 5 I guess) that were around Mark Shuttleworth
to set it up and get a website going. It was an ill-advised
effort since I was too busy with examinations really to take
it on; so I gave it up soon after. But it is still going today,
people are still involved.</p><h2 id=hoary>Hoary</h2><p>Next came Hoary in 2005 and I was blown away how fast improvements
were made; I still couldn&rsquo;t believe all this could be free&mldr; It
seemed too good to be true really; I thought if Mark Shuttleworth
ever left that would finish off Ubuntu and that would be it. While
that might be still true; other distributions out there do
tremendous work: Fedora is one I&rsquo;d use if there were no Ubuntu.</p><p><img src=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Ubuntu-desktop-2-504-20080706.png/180px-Ubuntu-desktop-2-504-20080706.png alt="Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog"></p><p>All I can say is this: while I was definitely interested in Information
Technology before (and knew I was heading for a Computer Science
course); I owe a lot to Linux and Ubuntu for showing me the nitty
gritty (that I wanted to see) and has helped me immesureably in
my College life. Of course now that Ubuntu is one of the most
polished Linux distrobutions out there it helps me when I need to
get away from the nitty gritty too ;) To end this post it is only
fitting to see the latest version:</p><p><img src=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Ubuntu.png/180px-Ubuntu.png alt=Ubuntu></p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
