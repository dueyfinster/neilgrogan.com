2006). Not knowing what to expect, I found a very different Germany from the
text book one you read about (Bavarian Trad Dress, Beer-drinking, Pretzel
Eating, Sausage loving etc!). Of course all of these elements were present,
but I think a modern German society closely reflects American one, in a lot of
ways. Germans are the largest group by ethnicity in United States, so maybe
its just German culture prevalent in America?</p><p>Here is a short explanation of what I found as I wrote to Family,
explaining how I was getting on:</p><p>Their school system is very different. Students talk over teachers, play with
their mobile phones or throw things at one another! Its a continous assessment
system with A-F represented by numbers 1-6. I have had a trip to Friedberg
(Watch capitol of Europe once) and a brief visit to Augsburg(guided tour with
trip). Also visited Dachau KZ (Konzantrationslager - Concentration Camp) its
very sad, the words “Arbeit Mich Frei” (Work will set you free) are on the
front gate. Lots of people were there, but you could literally hear a pin
drop. I also visited Bavarian Alps, got a ski lift to a traditional
restaurant they were all dressed in green and white! Got loads of photos!
English usage is very heavy, most Germans have a good command of it, the radio
plays exact same songs as ours.</p><p>I am also getting on great with all the girls (mostly girls chose to go), now
that I have seen what there really like, there even sounder outside of school.
I get a bus to school with Jens (My Exchange Student), sometimes his mother
drives us. It is very cold here -10c most of the time. Snow can be upto 1m
high, then again I am told they get nice summers! Turkish influence is very
noticeable, every town nearly has a kebab shop. Houses here are a lot
cheaper(than Ireland)! Approx 3 times size of my house is only €20,000 more.
I should have photos soon!</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/travel>#travel</a></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=../js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
