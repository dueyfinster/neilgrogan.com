papers to my email inbox every morning. I think it&rsquo;s very important to
catch up on the latest news; as I think you are more informed and have
conversation pieces to talk to people (for those awkward silences where
&ldquo;Ye the weather is terrible&rdquo; just won&rsquo;t do). So I was highly informed
when I read this piece: <a href="http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/dcu-head-hits-out-at-outofdate-okeeffe-1532789.html?from=dailynews">DCU head hits out at &lsquo;out-of-date&rsquo;
O&rsquo;Keeffe</a>.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a tension between the traditional expectation that
universities will primarily teach students, and the more recent
requirement for universities to underpin economic development and
attract corporate research and development into Ireland . . . not to
mention the role of universities as agencies of cultural regeneration
and of tackling disadvantage and structural poverty,&rdquo; said Prof von
Prondzynski.</p></blockquote><p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. I think it is disgraceful that students who try
to improve themselves; their standard of living and their community by
getting a great education are penalised with higher fees. The equal
access to education that the state is trying to promote will be further
harmed by an increase in fees. It is [relatively] cheap to go to college
as it is; and still the economic underclass are under-represented.</p><p>Nothing is for free don&rsquo;t get me wrong&mldr; But these students turn in to
some of the hardest and most innovative workers in the world; and most
get a really good salary to match; which means they pay the most tax on
average of any socio-economic class. People in the super-rich category
can afford to off-shore; not so for these professional people. People in
the lowest socio-economic classes pay the standard rate of 20% as they&rsquo;d
earn under the average industrial wage (about 30,000) and rightly so. So
that just leaves the &lsquo;higher&rsquo; if-you-will middle class (although all
terms are relative; I don&rsquo;t agree with the labels personally); which pay
disproportionate amount. So the
<a href=http://www.gov.ie/>Government</a><a href=http://www.gov.ie/>s</a> policy seems to
discourage many of these people from actually educating themselves and
getting a good job. This shocking tidbit sums up the government:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think he (Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe) has a view of how universities should
operate which is fairly far removed from what my view would be. For
example, he raised the issue of whether we do too much research,&rdquo; said
Prof von Prondzynski (<a href=http://www.dcu.ie/>Dublin City University</a>
Head)</p></blockquote><p>Too much research? Oh my god; I actually cannot believe I read that.
Maybe I should write to Batt O&rsquo;Keefe and remind him what research gets
you&mldr; Just in the Tech field alone (which I know most about); research
is everything. The Internet? Check, American Military Research
(Arpanet). The Web? Check, CERN Particle Physics Laboratory. Graphical
Interfaces? Check, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Not to
mention the massive contribution by Bell Labs/AT&T to Unix etc. These
are only ones right off the top of my head. All I can say is I hope 3rd
Level (as Colleges are known in Ireland) gets their own government
minister (and department) and is free of this man: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batt_O'Keeffe">Batt O&rsquo;
Keefe</a> and his 20th century
