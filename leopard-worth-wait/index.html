OS upgrade, with every major application recieving attention. To me I am
overjoyed the finder is getting a revamp, though I am not certain
following iTunes layout is such a good idea. I think this is Steve Jobs
(CEO. Apple Inc) idea to &ldquo;switch&rdquo; windows people since they already use
iTunes, although I am not sure it is the right path. I choose Mac OS X
because its unique, it has a fresh take on how a user interacts with a
computer, moreso than Linux (which adopts tried and true in the case of
Gnome and KDE), and certainly Windows which has only tweaked the look
since Windows 95: its the same concept. The fanning out of dock icons,
and grouping them won&rsquo;t be used by the vast majority of users: its the
same reason they don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;smart&rdquo; folders: its a feature that has
little in the way of wide appeal. I know the same can be said of the
dashboard, and I personally will most likely end up buying and using
fanning out and collections in Leopard, but my experience of novices is
that they are afraid of the unknown.</p><p>Perhaps why I wrote this is that I don&rsquo;t understand what people really
expected from Apple. Comments such as &ldquo;everything in Leopard has been
done before&rdquo;, well I think this statement is true of every consumer
Operating System: things (generally) don&rsquo;t get tried out on novice
users. So back to my question: is it worth the wait? Look at the above
list and decide for yourself. I feel Tiger is good enough (then again
Technology never stays still, Bill Gates &ldquo;128K RAM is good enough for
anyone should tell us that), and I predict Leopard will face adoption
like Windows does: Tech buffs will buy the boxed retail version (I
include myself in this), while everybody else will get it through a new
computer purchase.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/apple>#apple</a>
