<h1 class="post-title">iPhone 3G Review</h1>
    
    <time>April 9, 2009</time>
    

    <div>
        
        <p>
        <p>I recently got an iPhone 3G and away from
all that Apple mania; I thought I would give an honest review. This is
framed in the mindset of all the past Nokia devices (which I have posted
about here also) which I have owned.</p>
<p>Okay so where to start? Well I think a good place would be what I could
have bought instead. Strange place for a review; but its good to see
what is out there and what I was looking at beforehand.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Nokia XpressMusic 5800</strong>
Nokia make great phones; I have stuck to the reliability of Symbian on
their earlier phones for quite some time. I love Nokia; they mean
reliability when you need your phone most - always a top feature other
manufacturers never got quite right. Maybe its part inertia on my part -
I can&rsquo;t really say. Long story short is that this was a major
competitor: over the iPhone it has expandability and a lot more hardware
features (like RDS Radio), can play a lot more formats also. Downsides:
Got terrible reviews for poor Symbian integration with touch; that
plectrum looks downright stupid; it is not as sleek as iPhone in form
factor (although it is smaller), screen didn&rsquo;t seem as good to me.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTC Magic</strong>
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/HTC_magic_cropped.png/200px-HTC_magic_cropped.png"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/HTC_magic_cropped.png/200px-HTC_magic_cropped.png" alt="image"></a>Follow
up to the HTC Dream or GPhone; this Android device has probably the
coolest developer OS around. Lots of activity is going on around Android
at the moment; so the first phones to land in the UK and Ireland should
be more polished (using next gen Android: CupCake). Their is even rumors
it will be adapted and put on net books: possibly making it the standard
of mobile devices if given enough time. This will only bring more cool
apps in time and reduce Apple&rsquo;s iTunes Store lead. Downsides: Not
available yet; so I couldn&rsquo;t buy it. Doesn&rsquo;t have as much apps yet.
Isn&rsquo;t as polished in the software interface as iPhone. All of these can
be resolved with time however&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Palm Pre</strong>
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Palmpre.png"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Palmpre.png" alt="image"></a>I
hold out a lot of hope for this! Also Linux based; it promises a cool,
open Web developer community as all the apps are online. Web apps need a
lot more thought for offline use in my opinion, so I am reserving
judgement on this. The interface seems to rock; and developing for it
looks super easy&hellip; Downsides: not out yet, thus lack of Apps and
pricing info.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Some junk WinMob</strong>
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Sshot114(v2).png/240px-Sshot114(v2).png"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Sshot114(v2).png/240px-Sshot114(v2).png" alt="image"></a>Says
it all really: a smart-phone but for less than a good plain old
non-smartphone. Always made by some obscure Taiwanese outfit - not that
is a bad thing; after-all most iPhone parts come from there. For those
on a budget this was my last option; but darn cheap; just over â‚¬115 for
one! I could have bought one for every member of my immediate family for
the price of one iPhone: makes you think, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On to the review of the iPhone:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p><strong>Beautiful Interface:</strong><br>
It looks amazing: lets be honest. I have never seen a phone look quite
this good.</p>
<p><strong>Fingers:</strong><br>
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png/636px-IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png/636px-IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png" alt="image"></a>Using
only your hands is great; lets face it: you cannot forget your hands.
You can forget a stylus and even the iPhone itself; but those hands are
sticking with ye!</p>
<p>**Time: **<br>
I use my phone for time; Apple has it displayed elegantly, in the same
place, almost in all the phones&rsquo; screens. I love this as I can keep
myself aware of what I have to do next&hellip; All in glorious 24hr goodness,
they way time was meant to be displayed&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Lots of apps:</strong><br>
The App store grows bigger every day and all those little useful Apps
are really handy.</p>
<p>**Quick Interface: **<br>
The software interface is very fast at getting you to where you want to
go; to that Twitter application or your Web mail etc.</p>
<p><strong>Maps and Location based services:</strong><br>
I have seen the future: and it is the Internet that is location aware.
iPhone has taken the first tentative steps in this area with allowing
apps to use location; as well as building it into the camera and maps
applications.</p>
<p><strong>Great iPod:</strong><br>
Apple doesn&rsquo;t lie on this one. It is a great iPod. The best? I haven&rsquo;t
decided yet&hellip; but it&rsquo;s not far off&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Safari:</strong><br>
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Wikipedia_Main_Page_on_iPhone.png"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Wikipedia_Main_Page_on_iPhone.png" alt="image"></a>It
is the real web you get on an iPhone. Not only that: it is surprisingly
comfortable to navigate with. I haven&rsquo;t seen a mobile phone device come
this close before. The N810 has a great browser with flash; but all
round Safari wins on ease of use. I heard the earlier versions were very
buggy; maybe I got in just as Safari matured properly.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerometer:</strong><br>
Changing the view of applications as you rotate the phone was a
masterstroke. Some things just need to be viewed vertically; others
horizontally. The iPhone just makes it happen: seamlessly.. no buttons
and no fuss. Thumbs up!</p>
<p>SO-SO</p>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong><br>
Not a lot to complain or praise about the camera. It does it&rsquo;s job&hellip;
Their is no flash or other trickery other phones have to offer; so any
sub-optimal light and the iPhone may as well just not have a camera&hellip;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/IPhonehomescreen.PNG"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/IPhonehomescreen.PNG" alt="image"></a><strong>Cost:</strong><br>
Its darned expensive! I bought it contract-free and to say it burned a
hole in pocket is an understatement.</p>
<p><strong>One Inbox:</strong><br>
Nokia has this one on the button. I don&rsquo;t care whether its SMS, MMS,
E-Mail or a message through telekinesis: put it in one place please&hellip;
It&rsquo;s easier to check; and logically it makes more sense to not have to
visit ten apps for each. Bonus points for allowing developers to hook in
things like Twitter..</p>
<p><strong>Smudgy:</strong><br>
It smudges and scratches like nothing I have seen. They tried to make it
too shiny; at the cost of usability. I would prefer a grippier, less
pretty surface: but I am sure I am in a minority on this. I could
probably have even been overheard muttering &ldquo;Smudgy piece of ****&rdquo; .
Add to any price the cost of a cover&hellip;</p>
<p>**Keyboard: **<br>
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/IPhone_keyboard_unblured.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/IPhone_keyboard_unblured.jpg" alt="image"></a>Yes
I know how ugly hardware keyboards look: but they do work. The on-screen
keyboard to me: sucks. I much prefer the N810&rsquo;s on-screen one that I can
use with my thumbs. Using my index fingers just doesn&rsquo;t feel right; and
more to the point: all onscreen keyboards are crap. This is a major TODO
for any willing iPhone competitor&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Background Apps:</strong><br>
This may sound like a minor niggle: it&rsquo;s not. Only apps you can run in
the background is the phone, iPod, Safari and Mail. I don&rsquo;t even think
Safari and Mail are true background apps; in fact I know they aren&rsquo;t:
they suspend when they are not at the forefront.</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong><br>
iPhone OS 3.0 is set to fix notifications; apps will be able to display
a number next to their icon. I personally don&rsquo;t think that is good
enough. Is a notification area as seen on other phones (you know for
like calendar?) too much to ask? I would prefer that as the idle screen
rather than the pretty picture.</p>
<p><strong>Activation:</strong><br>
I already feel Apple doesn&rsquo;t trust me; but to force me to run around
trying to find a computer with iTunes to activate the thing (I wasn&rsquo;t
near home) is just pure stupid. Do it over the air (for free; at your
expense) or just don&rsquo;t bother. Fail on this, major fail.</p>
<p><strong>Rat race jailbreak:</strong><br>
Apple should just give up.. People are going to crack these no matter
what. You only inconvenience your customers (hint: not the networks; us
little people) with all this DRM nonsense. EA has it right: do the
minimal DRM for contract purposes.<br>
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/IPhone_Image_Viewer.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/IPhone_Image_Viewer.jpg" alt="image"></a></p>
<p><strong>Pay to release even a free app:</strong><br>
Its a shame Apple thought 30% markup wasn&rsquo;t steep enough&hellip; But even
developer of free applications have to pay $99 to release it on the
store. It would be fine if you could get the app another way&hellip; This
just causes more junk apps to appear at a cost&hellip; If they did this on OS
X it would be suicide; why not open up the iPhone to free software?<br>
**<br>
**<br>
<strong>No 3.5G:</strong><br>
I expect this was due to power; which is totally forgivable and
understandable. But a nice feature would be 3.5G for extra speed; I
expect this and 4G (WiMax?) will appear in later models..</p>
