I am a <a href=http://www.ubuntu.com/>Linux</a> and
<a href=http://www.apple.com/mac>Mac</a>
<a href="http://www.google.ie/search?q=define:aficionado&ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">aficionado</a>.
For my Linux machines, all of them are <a href=http://www.dell.com/open>Dell</a>.
I have been always pleased with Dells prices, how their machines work
with Linux, their customer service and the fact they are made in
Limerick, Ireland (I am from Ireland). I politely emailed Dell (well got
up on my high horse), heres my first mail:</p><blockquote><p>I would like a refund of Windows XP since I am installing Ubuntu Linux
on the computer when I get it. When I turn on the computer I am going
to decline the EULA, and I am within my rights to request this refund
(as part of Irish consumer laws). This also applies in Britian, see
here: (
<a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6144782.stm>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6144782.stm</a>
)</p></blockquote><p>So yeah I wasn&rsquo;t the most polite, but I was trying to make a point
because I guessed they&rsquo;d be not &lsquo;welcome&rsquo; to the idea. Boy was I wrong,
I got a lovely call from a Dell representitive telling me they would
refund it:</p><blockquote><p>As per our phone conversation I have arranged for you to be refunded
for this part. Please allow approximately 5 working days for the money
to show back on your credit card.</p><p>If you have any further queries please do not hesitate in responding
directly to this mail and I will be glad to assist you further.</p></blockquote><p>All I can say is I am definitely a Dell customer from now on. The sad
part of this story is perhaps Dell is out of pocket because of licensing
deals with Microsoft. But they did the right thing, and that is
honourable, it seems <a href=http://www.dellideastorm.com/>IdeaStorm</a> and
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dell>Michael Dell</a> returning is
working. I would gladly deny the refund. Why did I do this? I did it
because I oppose the ridiculous notion every PC has to come with
Windows, its like selling all black cars. People want choice and
variety, and consumer laws are supposed to protect and promote this ;-)
I won&rsquo;t be using
<a href=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsxp/default.mspx>XP</a>
and I will be true to my word and deny the
<a href=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/eula.mspx>EULA</a> as soon as I
receive the laptop.</p><p>Bootnote: Ubuntu Dells are available in France, Germany, UK and the US
but not in Ireland. I ordered through small business and specced the
laptop to the exact parts the Ubuntu Inspirons in the US have, all that
is different is the model numbers. Come on Dell, sell those Ubuntu
machines in Ireland, I&rsquo;ll buy another!!</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
