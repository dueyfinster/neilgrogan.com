        <p>
        <p>Picade is an arcade machine you build yourself which uses a raspberry pi as the brains. It is available from <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picade">Pimoroni</a>.</p>
<p>I really built this in 2024 as a fun object to sit in my office - and I must say it&rsquo;s lived up to that and more on video calls I&rsquo;ve done. Total time to assemble was about 3 hours, and I really enjoyed the process.</p>
<p>The main pieces are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cabinet - all the wooden sides, top and bottom</li>
<li>Perspex - all the plastic to cover the &ldquo;see-through&rdquo; areas like the title at the top and the button shelf.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi 5 with Picade Hat - Picade Hat handles all the interaction with sound and button hardware</li>
<li>Joystick - for all the motion</li>
<li>Buttons - all the gaming buttons! (plus on/off)</li>
<li>Speaker - for the sound of nostalgia</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">Pico-8</a> license so you can build your own games</li>
</ul>
<p>The instructions are very well written and clear. All the parts are well packed. The only parts I felt were fiddly were the plastic hinges for the cabinet (you need to get your hands in to tight spaces to tie down the screws) and the button  order. It&rsquo;s easy to mix up which button is connected where - so with this and installing the joystick/top plate the joystick attaches to I would take your time.</p>
<p>Frustrations I had:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a> (the linux distribution) is not plug and play - I had various issues controlling sound</li>
<li>Not clear to me how the consoles appear (turns out games working with emulators have file extensions, Picade picks this up and will know to launch .snes with SNES)</li>
<li>Loading games on was tedious until I installed and shared games directory with <a href="https://www.samba.org/">Samba</a></li>
<li>Mapping buttons for so many different emulators and systems is a nightmare - I was hoping someone would have just put in sensible defaults!</li>
</ul>
<p>Later, I ordered the <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picade-plasma-kit-illuminated-arcade-buttons">fancy illuminated buttons</a> after because for me, this is partly about playing and partly about a really nice object to talk about.</p>
<p>Overall this was a super fun project and getting to play some great games at the end was rewarding!!</p>
