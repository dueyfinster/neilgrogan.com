If you have never heard about Arch Linux, it is a &ldquo;roll your own&rdquo; Linux distribution. This basically means from start to finish, the whole process is custom. Whether your system has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or sound is totally up to you.
I switched from Ubuntu Linux, which is very much built for new people to Linux. I have been using Ubuntu since it&rsquo;s release in 2004 (as old as this blog incidentally).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 19, 2011</time>

You may ask what does that mean? - well it is simple. I love going to websites that are uncluttered, provide useful information and are to the point. It&rsquo;s also small things like having a really fast page load time. So here&rsquo;s a flavour of some of what I have been working on lately&mldr;</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 1, 2011</time>
<a class=tag href=../../tags/software>#software</a></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../nerf-war/>Reflection on 9-11</a></h2><div><p>It&rsquo;s been 10 years since the anniversary of 9/11 and much of the world has changed a lot in that period. We&rsquo;ve had full body scanners at airports, marshalls on flights, bombs hidden in toner cartridges and two wars. I reflected on this and remembered two really good articles I&rsquo;ll share here on the topic. Hopefully we&rsquo;ve changed for the better.
Yesterday I finally wrote something that&rsquo;s been bothering me for about ten years: The fact that Al Qaeda can&rsquo;t be as big and bad as it&rsquo;s made out to be, because its whole design violates every rule of guerrilla organisation.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 12, 2011</time>

I did not get the 3G version to keep costs down (no second carrier subscription in addition to smartphone I own). Here&rsquo;s my review, let it be noted I&rsquo;ve been an iOS user since version 2 (iPhone 3G) and although I have used devices from Android 1.6 and up - I&rsquo;ve never &lsquo;lived&rsquo; with them.
Motorola Xoom Aesthetics & Design First of all the design is very well executed.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 27, 2011</time>

Those of you who come here often know I reviewed Sennheiser HD595 before, which is a headset built for the quality of reproduction (I use that one for music).
There&rsquo;s not much you can say about a VOIP headset, so I am going to keep this short! The Plantronics .655 USB isn&rsquo;t the most comfortable headset and the usb connection seemed like a plus as I&rsquo;d never owned a USB headset.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 16, 2011</time>

They fall in to two categories: Irish radio and technology. Luckily, there is so much competition in this space it&rsquo;s hard to pick the best - so quality is high!

I would say it is luck, but my family thinks it&rsquo;s down to a lot of hard work and good grades! Either way, it&rsquo;s a great feeling in probably the most competitive jobs market (for potential employees) in years.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 13, 2011</time>
