ideology, a way of explaining why <em>you-oh-so-need-to-do-this-now</em>. Cloud computing

process is custom. Whether your system has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or sound is totally up to you.</p>
<p>I switched from Ubuntu Linux, which is very much built for new people to Linux. I have been using Ubuntu
since it&rsquo;s release in 2004 (as old as this blog incidentally). I have found it slowly moving away from my
power user needs from the release of the KDE 4.0 desktop up to the recently introduced Unity desktop for
Ubuntu. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love the whizz-bang effects of the snazzier distributions (like Ubuntu) and
have used it to show people the power of Linux (and how really groundbreaking Compiz effects were at the
time, ~2005). It&rsquo;s sad Compiz hasn&rsquo;t got the kudos but since both Windows and OS X have copied from Compiz,
some more usability has been gained.</p></p>

reflected on this and remembered two really good articles I&rsquo;ll share here
on the topic. Hopefully we&rsquo;ve changed for the better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I finally wrote something that&rsquo;s been bothering me for about ten years:
The fact that Al Qaeda can&rsquo;t be as big and bad as it&rsquo;s made out to be,
because its whole design violates every rule of guerrilla organisation.
It&rsquo;s like a counter intelligence officer&rsquo;s dream,
the Al Qaeda plan to bring guerrillas from all over the world,
introduce them to each other, and exchange funds, material and ideas.</p></p>

                <p><p>I recently bought the wifi version of the Motorola Xoom. I did not get the 3G version to
keep costs down (no second carrier subscription in addition to smartphone I own). Here&rsquo;s
my review, let it be noted I&rsquo;ve been an iOS user since version 2 (iPhone 3G) and although
I have used devices from Android 1.6 and up - I&rsquo;ve never &rsquo;lived&rsquo; with them.</p>

<h2 id="aesthetics--design">Aesthetics &amp; Design</h2>
<p>First of all the design is very well executed. It looks and feels like a premium tablet
should (should that be iPad competitor?). The ports are a clear winner and still are over
any other tablet. I haven&rsquo;t got the video dock yet, but I ampositiveit&rsquo;ll be
a great addition to my big HDTV. The only gripe really is that it doesn&rsquo;t charge through
usb, which I believe is because it has two batteries. It charges through supplied plug
insanely fast! It lasts all day and then some with heavy use also. I haven&rsquo;t left the
thing alone long enough to test the standby time, but I am sure it&rsquo;s good also. The 10.1&quot;
screen feels like the &lsquo;right&rsquo; size for a tablet and I&rsquo;ll besurprisedif more
tablets don&rsquo;t end up adopting a screen size closer to the Xoom&rsquo;s. The heft is a bit much,
I would like it to be a small bit lighter - but nearly all tablets with proper glass
screens will be heavy.</p></p>

                <p><p>I got a Plantronics .655 USB Headset mainly for the ability to do VOIP well.
Those of you who come here often know <a href="http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/03/review.html">I reviewed Sennheiser HD595 before</a>,
which is a headset built for the quality of reproduction (I use that one for music).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much you can say about a VOIP headset, so I am going to keep this short!
The Plantronics .655 USB isn&rsquo;t the most comfortable headset and the usb connection
seemed like a plus as I&rsquo;d never owned a USB headset. The mic quality is a lot better
with the USB connection (though I am guessing 90% is down to the fact it&rsquo;s directional
and pointed at your mouth), but the sound won&rsquo;t be.</p></p>
