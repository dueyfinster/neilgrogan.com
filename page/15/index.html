ads are for people that don&rsquo;t know how to avoid them! Not only do they stop
your banwidth from being wasted; they make a ton of websites more usuable. It
takes care of Flash Ads as well as static ones; using a filter that is
constantly updated. So even if some of the webs more devious and sneaky
advertisers try to circumvent it; AdBlock can have a fix to everyone online
within hours. It is definately my favourite extension! I don&rsquo;t block certain
ads like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft (the ones with decent reputations) as that
is how the people behind really good websites I frequent make a living. But
for all the rest trying to do pop-ups and pop-unders; I am sorry your days are
numbered! (Some people higly recommend
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433">flashblock</a> but I haven&rsquo;t
had a need to use it with AdBlock Plus yet).<br>

                <p><p>Well I think so! Got one there 2 months ago and forgot to write a blog post
about it. I got a &lsquo;01 model for a bargain price I believe; but this theory has
yet to be tested (I&rsquo;ll wait for a year to be up). As I mentioned before in
previous posts my parent&rsquo;s house is now in a remote location with no train/buses
anywhere nearby. So transport was essential! At this time also there was a major
crack down on learner drivers not being accompanied by a fully licensed driver
(of two years). So by the time I&rsquo;d saved the money for the car; got 10 lessons
and convinced anyone I knew with over two years full driving experience to
accompany me; even to work - was just to much hassle - hence the moped which has
no such onerous requirements. In fact only one it does really have is that you
can&rsquo;t have passengers - I won&rsquo;t be carrying anyone anyways - so I am not too
bothered. Anyhoo take a look at the photos I took when I got it. I have done it
up since then: new tyres, resprayed exhaust, full service; new mirrors; repaired
exhaust; flushed out radiator and put in proper coolant just to name a few. So
it sounds allot better and drives better than ever!</p></p>
