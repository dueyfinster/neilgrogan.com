I use the calender, chat, code, sites, pages, docs the whole lot. One of
my friends even jokes &ldquo;You should just work at Google Marketing&rdquo;. Yes I
like most of Google&rsquo;s products; but I am a products guy; I use whats
good, cheap and fast (pick two). Google has the cheap down due to
ad-revenue; for the moment anyways in the current financial turmoil.</p></p>

are so good; no mystery here folks: its is literally bred into children

Kilkenny is only around 100,000 people it still has a large amount of
people to pick from and they get the best training which equals the best

                <p><p>Well I
think so! Got one there 2 months ago and forgot to write a blog post
about it. I got a &lsquo;01 model for a bargain price I believe; but this
theory has yet to be tested (I&rsquo;ll wait for a year to be up). As I
mentioned before in previous posts my parent&rsquo;s house is now in a remote
location with no train/buses anywhere nearby. So transport was
essential! At this time also there was a major crack down on learner
drivers not being accompanied by a fully licensed driver (of two years).
So by the time I&rsquo;d saved the money for the car; got 10 lessons and
convinced anyone I knew with over two years full driving experience to
accompany me; even to work - was just to much hassle - hence the moped
which has no such onerous requirements. In fact only one it does really
have is that you can&rsquo;t have passengers - I won&rsquo;t be carrying anyone
anyways - so I am not too bothered. Anyhoo take a look at the photos I
took when I got it. I have done it up since then: new tyres, resprayed
exhaust, full service; new mirrors; repaired exhaust; flushed out
radiator and put in proper coolant just to name a few. So it sounds
allot better and drives better than ever!</p></p>

2008! Summer has been okay so far; I&rsquo;ve had nothing much to report hence
lack of Tech posts. Sure the iPhone 3G looks good,
Google/Yahoo/Microsoft spats interesting but after a while it become a
bit circular and repetitive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started working at the UK&rsquo;s leading retailer for
touring/car/bike and accessories; as well as a move to the south east of
Ireland; that much further to the capital: Dublin. It&rsquo;s Ireland&rsquo;s
smallest city and home to Ireland&rsquo;s very first Parliament about 400
years ago: Kilkenny. It&rsquo;s steeped in culture and it&rsquo;s the only city in
Ireland to rival Dublin&rsquo;s culture, nightlife and restaurants and hold
it&rsquo;s own.</p></p>

                <p><p>I had a trip in to the faire capital city of Ireland today:
Dublin. Okay I&rsquo;ll get this out of the way: I had a Frappacino in
Starbucks and I&rsquo;m a student; so not too poor of a student ;)</p>
<p>But I saw the inside of Brown Thomas for the first time. I don&rsquo;t shop
for fashion at all: but what I found was the kind of vulgarity and
fake-ness I&rsquo;d expect of London or New York; not Dublin. To paraphrase
Bono: &ldquo;In America if you have your mansion on a hill people look up to
you and think &lsquo;I want to be like him and afford a house like that one
day&rsquo;; if you have the same mansion in Ireland people say &rsquo;look at the
fucken eejit on the hill with that house; thinks he&rsquo;s god or sumthen&rsquo;&rdquo;
and that to me was always an endearing part of Irish culture; people
around you being the great leveller if you thought you were the bomb.
Inside BT (Brown Thomas) was all the names you&rsquo;d expect; all the major
names more at home in Paris, London or New York. I confronted my friend
who was showing me round about my opinions (in my usual polite manner:
just say it). To my surprise he agreed 110%. Yes he said: for the people
who buy this stuff can tell who else is wearing it; and I think he meant
that by this logic movers and shakers also wore all the brands to look
the part. Soon after he told me he was also learning Golf because he
knew it would be a great benefit for his future career: &ldquo;All important
people also play golf&rdquo; he assured me.</p></p>
