Half serious a guy takes a look back at when he had to beat up a Girl. Weird stuff!
Yes, you read that right, I had to beat up a girl â€¦ not a woman. She was asking for it and she deserved it.

Got one there 2 months ago and forgot to write a blog post about it. I got a &lsquo;01 model for a bargain price I believe; but this theory has yet to be tested (I&rsquo;ll wait for a year to be up). As I mentioned before in previous posts my parent&rsquo;s house is now in a remote location with no train/buses anywhere nearby. So transport was essential!</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 17, 2008</time>

Summer has been okay so far; I&rsquo;ve had nothing much to report hence lack of Tech posts. Sure the iPhone 3G looks good, Google/Yahoo/Microsoft spats interesting but after a while it become a bit circular and repetitive.
I&rsquo;ve recently started working at the UK&rsquo;s leading retailer for touring/car/bike and accessories; as well as a move to the south east of Ireland; that much further to the capital: Dublin.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 29, 2008</time>

Okay I&rsquo;ll get this out of the way: I had a Frappacino in Starbucks and I&rsquo;m a student; so not too poor of a student ;)
But I saw the inside of Brown Thomas for the first time. I don&rsquo;t shop for fashion at all: but what I found was the kind of vulgarity and fake-ness I&rsquo;d expect of London or New York; not Dublin.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 14, 2008</time>
<a class=tag href=../../tags/business>#business</a></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../will-google-buy-skype/>Will Google Buy Skype?</a></h2><div><p>It&rsquo;s been all over the tech news world lately; apparently Google is muling over taking Skype off of Ebay&rsquo;s hands. Ebay has already written down the value of Skype as a large loss on their purchase price of $2.6 billion in stock and cash. But would Skype&rsquo;s G-branded future be any better?
I think it would be. Skype is a strong international brand for voice calls, instant messaging and video calls; but of course it competes directly with Google Talk.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 9, 2008</time>

I am a staunch supporter of the European project; or at least the ideals it is based on to create a peaceful, demcratic union of countries with a common background and share similiar goals. Intrigued by the article I read it only to find out that a local man who used to represent my area was responsible. I had to write to him to ask how he lost his mind&mldr;.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 16, 2008</time>

What makes it so good? Have you ever heard of Amarok? Chances are if your an OS X or Windows user; you haven&rsquo;t. All this is about to change! The amarok team are busy porting it from it&rsquo;s UNIX underpinnings to Windows and OS X.
Whats to like about Amarok then?</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 14, 2008</time>

It wasn&rsquo;t expected for Nokia to introduce an upgrade to the N800 Internet Tablet (which I also reviewed here) so soon. I certainly don&rsquo;t envy the position of a small team getting the hardware and software for a mini-computer right in such a short space of time. But needless to say the N810 feels right; in fact it feels more right than the N770 which I thought had the best design of all (be it functionality not so much style).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 13, 2008</time>

As Ars Technica points out:
As predicted last quarter, however, Apple broke its tie for third place with Gateway by shipping 1.33 million units and growing by a whopping 37.2 percent (double that of any other US vendor) from third quarter 2006 to claim 8.1 percent of the US market for the quarter.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 21, 2007</time>
