            <div>
                <p><p>This is my letter to U.S. Dept. of Commerce, stating what I believe should
happen to the Internet. Fell free to email your opinions to them directly: **
<a href="DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov">DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov</a>**. As a net citizen, get your voice heard on
the most important public debate of our times!   Dear Sir/Madam,   I, as a
citizen of Ireland and the EU, think with respect, the Internet should have a
world governing body, fairly appointed by each country who has more than 30%
of their respective populations online. For those under 30% they should get to
have a sub-committee, to prioritise and promote the Internet in their
countries. I think while although ICANN has generally not been a bad governing
body, vast improvements can be made, such as not allowing pressure from
companies to increase domain prices, when the cost of providing them has come
down dramatically over the past few years. I do recognise, that the Internet
was partially created with the help of U.S. government funding, but this comes
from the people of America, who would want the Internet to be a force for
change, like for example, the way it is helping Chinese dissidents.Also, as
with all US government generated ideas, it is free from patent and copyright
which applies worldwide, such as NASA images, for example. This should be true
of the Internet also, as it is with GPS (which I use regularly, Thanks for
that!). I am not a whole believer in the U.N. however, I think the Internet
governing body should be free form all Government and International
organisational pressures (but not those that seek to limit abuse, such as
child pornography, obviously). I thank you for offering a public debate on
this issue and I sincerely hope the outcome will be of benefit to everyone
living on earth.</p></p>

                <p><p>I recently found a great documentary, about 9/11, entitled Loose Change
9/11][]. It is easily the most powerful about the event, much more so than
Fahrenheit 9/11. In fact I would even argue, that if this documentary had of
aired during the U.S. presedential election, I would have bet on a different
result. Backed up by trusted resources such as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm" title="BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well">BBC which confirmed at
least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well</a>. Filled with outrageous
facts, it sets the scene for either a highly competent Bush regime that new
what it was doing, or the worst domestic tragedy that happend under
maladministration. Either way the American people have serious questions to
ask, which I hope in time will get the aired in time. Maybe George W. is
taking a leaf out of Charlie Haugheys book? That is that corruption can be a
force for the good of the public, and my rich friends?</p></p>

a community wifi project, sending me out a free router!! I am exicted about
this, as I hope to convince all my neighbours eventually to get it, and maybe
who knows, I may even achieve the biggest fon hotspot, if I take my campaign
estate wide, to neighbours all around! I want to “eat my own dog food” as they
say, so I will wait until I have recieved and used my router before I
recommend it to non-technical people. I have read of long delays on FON’s
forums, so I expect iot should be here within two to three weeks, maybe a
little longer. Also it comes with a european plug, not a Irish/British one,
which is a bit of a disappointment that I will have to root out the
screwdriver to make it fit!!!</p></p>

<p>In Ireland we, like the rest of the world, have though questions to answer.
Ireland being an island economy, is especially reliant on oil, none of which
we produce. I was surprised earlier this week to hear one of George W. Bush’s
top aides, saying that the U.S. needs to lose dependence on foreign oil and
research alternatives. I was never more shocked, to hear Bush’s change of
heart, from using improved technology, to one of his aides saying they need to
use less oil. Part of me was angry, as he defiantly rejected Kyoto agreement,
when the United States produces 25+% of all greenhouse gases.</p></p>

<p>Spam has become a fact of life nowadays, but is their anything we can do to
stop it? The answers boils down to no, we can’t. If we make it illegal, the
spamsters move abroad or go underground, as we have seen in the United States.
People have been prosecuted, but again this does not deter people. Spamhaus
have a novel idea, by trusting domains on reputation, based on spam reports.
But this has one fatal flaw, it involves people reporting spam.</p></p>

                <p><p>Google have released a calendar, as part of their mission to “Organise the
Worlds Information”. While it is what you expect from Google, the Calendar did
not impress me a whole lot. It does have an intuitive interface, that is easy
to use. It does integrate with Gmail, although the full extent has yet to be
seen, as they fall short of mentioning it in Gmail at all, but I would expect
this to change. I see great potential for users though, and where Google is
heading. They will eventually integrate it with GoogleTalk and Gmail,
producing a hybrid interface where you can organise a conference on
GoogleTalk, schedule it on your calendar (which is syncronised with your PC
and your workgroup server [therby informing fellow employees]), submit video
of it to Google Video, write minutes with writely, email minutes with Gmail,
that mail (with document and video) being attached to the meeting on the
Calendar, which is in turn archived on your PC in Google Desktop and your
Gmail Drive. While that is only one scenario, it is very possible. Google have
already leaked information on their eagerness to hold the entire contents of
ones&rsquo; hard drive on the internet.</p></p>

                <p><p>I am all for open standards, but they face huge problems. Not least is lack of
intergration between them. Take SIP used by VOIP providers, such as
<a href="http://www.wengo.com/">OpenWengo</a>. While OpenWengo is open source, and it is SIP, they are not
helpful in informing you how to use other clients, or dial other OpenWengo
users from other networks.</p>
<p>What I am really talking about is the need for an all-in-one communications
program, that is multi-platform. Their is already open source code for: Google
Talk (aka Jabber), MSN, AOL, ICQ, SIP, H.323, Yahoo! but why isn’t their an
all-in-one client? Surely it would be easy to reimplement some code from other
programs into Ekiga (SIP, H.323) , Kopete or Gaim (both Jabber, MSN, Yahoo,
AOL and ICQ)? I know GoogleTalk is based on SIP, so why not SIP compatability?
That is poor implementation which is fragmenting the Open Source community,
how are we going to challenge MSN’s userbase with this sort of fragmentation?
That said I like Google Talk and its way of doing things. Also it is rumoured
GoogleTalk will be interoperable with AOL at protocol level, since Google owns
5% of AOL.</p></p>
