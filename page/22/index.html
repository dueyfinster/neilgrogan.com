<a href="http://www.opensource.org/" title="Open Source">Open Source</a>/<a href="http://www.fsf.org/" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software</a> ways? No, definately 100% NOT. I’ll explain
why: I think Apple Computer has an incredible product in Mac OSx. For anyone who
has not used it before, pop into a 3G store and ask to have a go. When someone releases
a good a product as that, they deserve money, in my opinion. Under “the” free software
license (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt" title="GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a>) it is permissable for anyone to charge
for software licensed under it, as long as an offer of source code is given (for
3 years afterwards). Deep down I love <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu</a>, and I will install it as soon
as possible when they release a version for the Intel powered Apple computers.
In fact I will use my Laptop to showcase Ubuntu you had of told me November last
year I’d spend well over €1,000 on an <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>, I would have told you that
I hated Apple, and would never consider it! What has changed my mind? I got a iPod
Nano for Christmas ‘05 and thought it was great, but the Nano on its own still wouldn’t
convince me to get a Mac.</p></p>

Search engines would be just another litagation filled business, like so many
other. With Lawyers reviewing every site to go into the database, Google would

                <p><p>This is my letter to U.S. Dept. of Commerce, stating what I believe should
happen to the Internet. Fell free to email your opinions to them directly: **
<a href="DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov">DNSTransition@ntia.doc.gov</a>**. As a net citizen, get your voice heard on the
most important public debate of our times! Dear Sir/Madam, I, as a citizen of
Ireland and the EU, think with respect, the Internet should have a world
governing body, fairly appointed by each country who has more than 30% of their
respective populations online. For those under 30% they should get to have a
sub-committee, to prioritise and promote the Internet in their countries. I
think while although ICANN has generally not been a bad governing body, vast
improvements can be made, such as not allowing pressure from companies to
increase domain prices, when the cost of providing them has come down
dramatically over the past few years. I do recognise, that the Internet was
partially created with the help of U.S. government funding, but this comes from
the people of America, who would want the Internet to be a force for change,
like for example, the way it is helping Chinese dissidents.Also, as with all US
government generated ideas, it is free from patent and copyright which applies
worldwide, such as NASA images, for example. This should be true of the Internet
also, as it is with GPS (which I use regularly, Thanks for that!). I am not a
whole believer in the U.N. however, I think the Internet governing body should
be free form all Government and International organisational pressures (but not
those that seek to limit abuse, such as child pornography, obviously). I thank
you for offering a public debate on this issue and I sincerely hope the outcome
will be of benefit to everyone living on earth.</p></p>

                <p><p>I recently found a great documentary, about 9/11, entitled Loose Change 9/11][].
It is easily the most powerful about the event, much more so than Fahrenheit
9/11. In fact I would even argue, that if this documentary had of aired during
the U.S. presedential election, I would have bet on a different result. Backed
up by trusted resources such as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm" title="BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well">BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19
highjackers are alive and well</a>. Filled with outrageous facts, it sets the
scene for either a highly competent Bush regime that new what it was doing, or
the worst domestic tragedy that happend under maladministration. Either way the
American people have serious questions to ask, which I hope in time will get the
aired in time. Maybe George W. is taking a leaf out of Charlie Haugheys book?
That is that corruption can be a force for the good of the public, and my rich
friends?</p></p>

knows, I may even achieve the biggest fon hotspot, if I take my campaign estate
wide, to neighbours all around! I want to “eat my own dog food” as they say, so
I will wait until I have recieved and used my router before I recommend it to
non-technical people. I have read of long delays on FON’s forums, so I expect
iot should be here within two to three weeks, maybe a little longer. Also it
comes with a european plug, not a Irish/British one, which is a bit of a
disappointment that I will have to root out the screwdriver to make it fit!!!</p></p>

<p>In Ireland we, like the rest of the world, have though questions to answer.
Ireland being an island economy, is especially reliant on oil, none of which we
produce. I was surprised earlier this week to hear one of George W. Bush’s top
aides, saying that the U.S. needs to lose dependence on foreign oil and research
alternatives. I was never more shocked, to hear Bush’s change of heart, from
using improved technology, to one of his aides saying they need to use less oil.
Part of me was angry, as he defiantly rejected Kyoto agreement, when the United
States produces 25+% of all greenhouse gases.</p></p>

<p>Spam has become a fact of life nowadays, but is their anything we can do to stop
it? The answers boils down to no, we can’t. If we make it illegal, the spamsters
move abroad or go underground, as we have seen in the United States. People have
been prosecuted, but again this does not deter people. Spamhaus have a novel
idea, by trusting domains on reputation, based on spam reports. But this has one
fatal flaw, it involves people reporting spam.</p></p>

Worlds Information”. While it is what you expect from Google, the Calendar did
not impress me a whole lot. It does have an intuitive interface, that is easy to
use. It does integrate with Gmail, although the full extent has yet to be seen,
as they fall short of mentioning it in Gmail at all, but I would expect this to
change. I see great potential for users though, and where Google is heading.
They will eventually integrate it with GoogleTalk and Gmail, producing a hybrid
interface where you can organise a conference on GoogleTalk, schedule it on your
calendar (which is syncronised with your PC and your workgroup server [therby
informing fellow employees]), submit video of it to Google Video, write minutes with
writely, email minutes with Gmail, that mail (with document and video) being attached
to the meeting on the Calendar, which is in turn archived on your PC in Google Desktop
and your Gmail Drive. While that is only one scenario, it is very possible. Google
have already leaked information on their eagerness to hold the entire contents of
ones&rsquo; hard drive on the internet.</p></p>
