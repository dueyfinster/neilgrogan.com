I am very fortunate to be running Wordpress, the world&rsquo;s best blogging tool (and it is open source). I looked up the fabulous theme site to go with it, and I came across this one and liked it very much. The last design was my own, but I had awful trouble implementing to look the same in all browsers (especially Internet Explorer, even the latest one, argh).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 14, 2007</time>

What do I think? Well I have put of writing this for 4 days, as I wanted to really test it out. Before I start, I should say I was part of the Nokia Developer Device program, and I got the Nokia N800 at a big discount, €300 off the €399 retail price in fact.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 11, 2007</time>

But this is nothing new, it happend with XP. How do you convince people the latest and greatest is worth the money? Microsoft is in a tough position due to stiff competition - old, working, fully-compatible windows machines don&rsquo;t disappear into thin air. There has been a lot more FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt)abput Vista already from the Free and Open Source camp.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 2, 2007</time>

It serves as a record of your existance, a guide to people of what your life was like. Why? is the most obvious question you might ask. Well I will tell you what prompted me, which is the culmination of a lot of different things.
This brings me to the first reason: Television.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 30, 2007</time>
<a class=tag href=../../tags/internet>#internet</a></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../bbc-to-host-multi-os-debate-my-first/>BBC to host Multi-OS Debate and My First Web Auction</a></h2><div><p>BBC are putting together a Mac, Windows and Linux user, to debate the pros and cons of being a users for each operating system. While this in itself is good news (more airtime for alternatives), most of the comments are highly in favour of Linux, then Mac and lastly Windows. This is part of the BBC&rsquo;s coverage of Windows Vista. My hope for the future is that Mac and Linux gain at least 10% each (20% total) over the next 5 years of the home desktop market, as this will push innovation forward, like AMD and Intel competition.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 25, 2007</time>

<a class=tag href=../../tags/linux>#linux</a></div></article><article><h2><a href=../../get-facts-about-get-facts/>Get the facts, about "Get the Facts"</a></h2><div><p>Just a quick blurb about some things Microsoft like to say: Don&rsquo;t believe it, well at least not it all anyway. On the Irish &ldquo;Get the Facts&rdquo; page (on Windows Server vs. Linux), they make critical errors of judgement a person reasonably well versed in computing could deconstruct. First of all, Linux isn&rsquo;t a server, its a kernel, like the Windows kernel. So comparing &ldquo;Windows Server 2003&rdquo; to &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; is misleading to say the least, and stupid to say the most.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 21, 2007</time>

I drew my Engineering project (Leaving Certificate) on it, to see if it was easy enough for a novice (Read: Me) to mess around and get something functional out of it. Most people have heard of Computer Aided Design, but usually the applications are expensive to say the least. Not so with Google Sketchup, it is totally free and can import some of the most popular 3D drawing formats.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 14, 2007</time>

I bought i for a couple of reasons, namely price and storage. I had been put off before since I thought they were too bulky ( I know a couple of people who have older generation iPod Videos) after being with the Nano for over a year (its still chugging along gleefully).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>December 30, 2006</time>
