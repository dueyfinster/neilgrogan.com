not a technology related post, but I get asked about it alot and people have
sketchy details about what it is (ie. they know my vision is messed up).
<strong>Keratoconus</strong> (from Greek: <em>kerato-</em> horn, cornea; and <em>konos</em> cone), is a
degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye in which structural changes
within the cornea cause it to thin and change to a more conical shape than its
normal gradual curve. In plain English, light bends in a distorted way to make
vision ghosted, blurry and less sharp. Glasses cannot fix this problem as they
fix issues with your natural lense behind the cornea, as usually it has improper
focus.</p></p>

unfortunately its Mac specific, but really only iSquint program is, so if anyone
can suggest a replacement on Windows or Linux, I will add it to the details of
the video. I use Garageband for audio, iMovieHD to edit the video and audio and
Copernicus to record my screen. I started by getting everything I needed ready
(all the Firefox tabs etc.) and hit record in Copernicus. I imported that .mov
into iMovieHD, and then proceeded to open Garageband, watch the video and talk
myself through my own recording. I saved the voice part in Garageband, exported
it and then imported it into iMovie. I checked to make sure the audio and video
lined up perefectly (what I done on screen matched what I was saying) and then
exported it as a .mov from iMovieHD. Then I uploaded the result to Youtube,
which I think for a first try ain&rsquo;t bad!! Watch it here:</p></p>

Your behaviour online is by no means private, you hand over your numerical
address, browser details, country, city, versions of which plugins you use,
where you came from, just to name a few. You may have seen on sites something to
the effect of &ldquo;Welcome Google user!&rdquo;, that website knows exactly what you typed
to get to it. Tor routes your online activity through different computers, for

a note on the new look, hope you like it. I am very fortunate to be running
<a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="Wordpress Blogging Software">Wordpress</a>, the world&rsquo;s
best blogging tool (and it is open source). I looked up the fabulous theme site
to go with it, and I came across this one and liked it very much. The last
design was my own, but I had awful trouble implementing to look the same in all
browsers (especially Internet Explorer, even the latest one, argh). I know the
old one can be improved, so I am submitting to
<a href="http://themes.wordpress.net/" title="Wordpress Themes">WP Themes directory</a>, which I
will update this post with the link. I love the new theme, it brings what I
couldn&rsquo;t to the old one: choosable colours and sameness across browsers. I&rsquo;d
like to thank Justin Winslow for that! Did I mention that the exact same colours
are used in this theme? It brings a total different look though, the power of
perception! So now you know these are the official DF&rsquo;s colours!</p></p>
