Now take Linux; really a Kernel, but packaged means an Operating System.
Which way you package it makes all the difference! You still use the
same drivers, the boot process is still the same, but when your machine
finishes its boot and launches all that graphics stuff anything can
appear: <strong>anything</strong>. It&rsquo;s abstraction to have no real graphics in a
kernel other than that which are drivers to control hardware. This is
very strange to people who think in the Windows way (nb. I used to be
one of these). At the end of Windows XP booting I have never seen
anything but Luna; and most people don&rsquo;t know its called that. So it is
very strange for people my age and slightly older who grew up over DOS
and Windows 3.1/95 line to have this fundamental shift in logic.</p></p>

                <p><p>Last year was me celebrating four years of using the best
operating system out there: <a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux</a> and the best distro
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. Ubuntu was my first foray in to Linux; and I
haven&rsquo;t left it since; although I have tried all the other
major distros. I started with the first version of Ubuntu;
Warthy Warthog:</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png/180px-Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png" alt="Warthy Warthog"></p>
<p>Warthy had a text only installer and it took me quite a while
to not only get used to the idea of this strange operating
system; but the fear of leaving Windows-land where all that
power usage knowledge would mean nothing. It meant nothing
in terms of the registry and other superficial stuff; but the
more I used Ubuntu and Linux the more I liked it. In fact in
2005 I ditched my XP installation altogether. I noticed there
wasn&rsquo;t an Irish Ubuntu users group; so I mailed one of the
few people (around 5 I guess) that were around Mark Shuttleworth
to set it up and get a website going. It was an ill-advised
effort since I was too busy with examinations really to take
it on; so I gave it up soon after. But it is still going today,
people are still involved.</p></p>

                <p><p>Recently I downloaded the <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a> packages of
the new <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 4.2 beta 2. For those of you who
don&rsquo;t know; KDE is the <a href="http://www.kde.org/">K Desktop Environment</a>;
which includes a window manager
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwin">KWin</a>), common desktop
applications, its own menu
(<a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html">Kickoff</a>),
browser (<a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a>), file manager
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_(software)">dolphin</a>) etc.
Basically it is the most popular desktop environment on Linux next to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME">Gnome</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>**What is so special about KDE? **<br>
The philosophy of KDE is the advanced configuration it allows through
its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI">Graphical User Interface</a> (GUI),
this is versus <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> which chooses sane
defaults and leaves configuration in hard to reach places and
out-of-sight. This isn&rsquo;t to say KDE doesn&rsquo;t choose sane defaults; it
does and is very user-friendly. KDE has always been the more
Windows-like of the major desktop environments and this hasn&rsquo;t really
changed in KDE 4.X series. KDE is available in popular distributions of
Linux such as Kubuntu, <a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva</a>,
<a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/">OpenSuse</a>. The special part about 4.X
series is that for the first time for any Linux desktop environment; it
is fully cross-platform, easily installs and works on Microsoft Windows
and Apple Mac OS X.</p></p>

are for people that don&rsquo;t know how to avoid them! Not only do they stop
your banwidth from being wasted; they make a ton of websites more
usuable. It takes care of Flash Ads as well as static ones; using a
filter that is constantly updated. So even if some of the webs more
devious and sneaky advertisers try to circumvent it; AdBlock can have a
fix to everyone online within hours. It is definately my favourite
extension! I don&rsquo;t block certain ads like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft (the
ones with decent reputations) as that is how the people behind really
good websites I frequent make a living. But for all the rest trying to
do pop-ups and pop-unders; I am sorry your days are numbered! (Some

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">FPS</a> and generally
devious natured video games (like the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)">GTA</a>
franchise). Does that make me a bad person who wants to kill people? Of
course not; nothing could be further from the truth. But some people
stick their fingers in their ears and shout &ldquo;LA LA LA
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre">Columbine</a>
LALALA Terrorists LALALA Violent Video Games!&rdquo;. They say it is
destructive to childrens young precious minds. The &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_The_Children_(politics)">Think of The
Children</a>&rdquo;
argument always disgusted me; its like shouting Fire in a packed room
when their is no danger: it is false, just to garner attention and a
sickening twisted version of the facts. Are violent video games harmful
to kids? <em>Probably</em>; I wouldn&rsquo;t advocate giving them access since they;
just like movies are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_European_Game_Information"><strong>clearly rated for
Adults</strong></a>. *
