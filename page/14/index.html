<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">browser</a> to this list also! Let&rsquo;s
look at the two most popular consumer Operating Systems (in three variants) and
their Desktop Environments:</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)">Safari 2.X</a> Now take
Linux; really a Kernel, but packaged means an Operating System. Which way you
package it makes all the difference! You still use the same drivers, the boot
process is still the same, but when your machine finishes its boot and launches
all that graphics stuff anything can appear: <strong>anything</strong>. It&rsquo;s abstraction to
have no real graphics in a kernel other than that which are drivers to control
hardware. This is very strange to people who think in the Windows way (nb. I
used to be one of these). At the end of Windows XP booting I have never seen
anything but Luna; and most people don&rsquo;t know its called that. So it is very
strange for people my age and slightly older who grew up over DOS and Windows
3.1/95 line to have this fundamental shift in logic.</p></p>

                <p><p>Last year was me celebrating four years of using the best operating system out
there: <a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux</a> and the best distro <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. Ubuntu was my first foray in to
Linux; and I haven&rsquo;t left it since; although I have tried all the other major
distros. I started with the first version of Ubuntu; Warthy Warthog:</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png/180px-Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png" alt="Warthy Warthog"></p>
<p>Warthy had a text only installer and it took me quite a while to not only get
used to the idea of this strange operating system; but the fear of leaving
Windows-land where all that power usage knowledge would mean nothing. It meant
nothing in terms of the registry and other superficial stuff; but the more I
used Ubuntu and Linux the more I liked it. In fact in 2005 I ditched my XP
installation altogether. I noticed there wasn&rsquo;t an Irish Ubuntu users group; so
I mailed one of the few people (around 5 I guess) that were around Mark
Shuttleworth to set it up and get a website going. It was an ill-advised effort
since I was too busy with examinations really to take it on; so I gave it up
soon after. But it is still going today, people are still involved.</p></p>

<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 4.2 beta 2. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know; KDE is
the <a href="http://www.kde.org/">K Desktop Environment</a>; which includes a window
manager (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwin">KWin</a>), common desktop
applications, its own menu
(<a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html">Kickoff</a>), browser
(<a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a>), file manager
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_(software)">dolphin</a>) etc. Basically it
is the most popular desktop environment on Linux next to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME">Gnome</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>**What is so special about KDE? **<br>
The philosophy of KDE is the advanced configuration it allows through its
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI">Graphical User Interface</a> (GUI), this is
versus <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> which chooses sane defaults and leaves
configuration in hard to reach places and out-of-sight. This isn&rsquo;t to say KDE
doesn&rsquo;t choose sane defaults; it does and is very user-friendly. KDE has
always been the more Windows-like of the major desktop environments and this
hasn&rsquo;t really changed in KDE 4.X series. KDE is available in popular
distributions of Linux such as Kubuntu, <a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva</a>,
<a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/">OpenSuse</a>. The special part about 4.X series is
that for the first time for any Linux desktop environment; it is fully
cross-platform, easily installs and works on Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac
OS X.</li>
