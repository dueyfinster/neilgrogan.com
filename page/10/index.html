It is an overwhelming feeling of relief, joy, sadness and all of the emotions you feel when leaving an institution that has been a huge part of my life, if only for four short years.
The best part of my course has been without doubt, the friends for life I have made.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 25, 2011</time>

Irish Businessman Denis O&rsquo;Brien started it and sold it to BT and made a fortune (and after got embroiled in a tribunal on accusations of impropriety). It is now called O2.I thought we got ripped off now with call charges now, how nostalgia can prove one wrong:</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 19, 2011</time>

Before I have used a can of compressed air, but this method is really neat and definitely lowered the fan sound emanating from my PS3.

I picked an area I was deeply interested in, smart phones. I am an avid iPhone user and I have bought Android phones also, they are great devices I can&rsquo;t imagine not having now that they are here. As part of my thesis I touched on the old way to develop apps, using Symbian C++ or J2ME and we&rsquo;ve come a long, long way since then.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 9, 2011</time>

I have to say for someone who constantly listens to a lot of music - good headphones like these are a must. They are expensive for sure, but Sennheiser do seem to have a great durability and solid build quality. This is my first set of such high quality headphones, so bear that in mind - I can&rsquo;t speak for other manufacturers in this space.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 5, 2011</time>

I have obviously been so quick to review this device, the iPhone 5 is upon us! My philosophy for reviewing items is you have to live with them. Well boy have I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do marvel at how good the hardware is. I&rsquo;ve dropped this extremely expensive device on occasions too numerous to count, so luckily it is designed well.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 18, 2011</time>

All the top level address&rsquo; will be gone, but the regional registries will still have stocks of address&rsquo; in to 2011. As a user of ipv6, I thought I could share sone thoughts/insights on the events ahead&mldr;
Below is a very good video which one of my favourite tech shows, Hak5 made with an IPv6 Consultant, Joe Klein.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 9, 2011</time>
