                <p><p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the shell and the productivity it brings, you can have a text
editor, command to run a server and more within easy reach. I use a shell at
work, at home and on the go. On the go could be using my iPad or iPhone. One of
the first SSH clients on iOS was iSSH, which I used many years ago. After this,
Panic released a professional class application called <a href="https://panic.com/prompt/">Prompt</a>. Prompt is
what I&rsquo;ve happily used for the last few years, but the 10 minute background
process limit is a constant pain. Just a quick switch away for a few minutes,
and you have to reconnect. That&rsquo;s fine once or twice, but when it happens many
times it seriously slows your productivity.</p></p>

money was going. But like all habits that are good for you, looking after your
finances takes time, care and attention. I started off by researching the market
for budgeting software. A lot of the prepackged software out there was very
US-centric, including Quicken, Microsoft Money and
<a href="https://www.mint.com">Mint.com</a>. I eventually settled on and bought a license
for <a href="https://www.ynab.com">You Need a Budget</a>, because: it had a budgeting
methodology, very good Euro support and was cross platform with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR">Adobe Air</a>. YNAB lasted me well for a
few years, with its pretty graphs and ease of expense entry. I even liked their
much pared-down companion iOS app at the time.</p></p>

filters? As it turns out you can&rsquo;t - my filter needs to act on email that
matched that filter <em>in the past</em>. So in other words: a filter can only act on
email it actually &ldquo;filters&rdquo;, which kinda makes sense! I&rsquo;m a big fan of

believed).</p>

<p>The book is really structured to convince those who do not believe in the

lots of money on office space (IBM, being one example).</p></p>

                <p><p>Early last year, I purchased two <a href="http://codekeyboards.com">Code Keyboards</a> (one for work and one for
home). The Code Keyboards are designed by <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com">Jeff Atwood</a> (who founded <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack
Overflow</a>). Mechanical keyboards are “old style” in that the switches are
from an era where everything was mechanical, unlike today where everything is
glass. So mechanical keyboards have ardent fans and people who don’t really care
for them.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/16/code_kb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I did a lot of research before I purchased, talking to various people in work
who are very knowledgeable about mechanical keyboards (The best community for
advice, discussion and group buys is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards">/r/mechanicalkeyboards</a> on reddit.).
The variety of hardware and opinions is positively mind melting. If you are
doing your own research, you should definitely come across <a href="http://cherryswitches.com">Cherry switches</a>
(a very established German brand). Switches are what sit between your key that
you see (with the letter printed on top) and the electronic board that converts
the key press to a signal the computer can understand.</p></p>

<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown by John Gruber.</a> The

<li>Write code once only</li>
<li>Keep interfaces very small</li>
<li>Seperate code in to modules</li>
<li>Couple modules loosely</li>
<li>Keep modules evenly sized</li>
<li>Keep codebase small (and look for ways to right-size)</li>
<li>Automate development pipeline and your tests</li>
<li>Write clean code and refactor as you go</li>
