Ubuntu Book (2nd Edition) is a nicely put together book for dealing with
the Linux operating system in a number of clearly laid out and well
presented chapters. Chapters are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introducing Ubuntu</li>
<li>Installing Ubuntu</li>
<li>Using Ubuntu on the Desktop</li>
<li>Advanced Usage and Managing Ubuntu</li>
<li>Ubuntu Server</li>
<li>Support / Typical Problems</li>
<li>Using Kubuntu</li>
<li>Ubuntu Community</li>
<li>Ubuntu-Related Projects</li>
<li>Using Edubuntu</li>
</ol>
<p>This book is a very complete introduction and contains suprising
elements related to finding out and joining the community of users -
which you will not find in other Ubuntu Books (such as O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Ubuntu
Hacks) which make it a unique and worthwhile addition to any Ubuntu
users personal library. It is most helpful to new users to Ubuntu, which
sections on installing and help with problems that could be faced.
Having said that, it falls short on the amount of truly unique
information that it contains - most of the books contents can be found
on the web. What you are paying for is a well-laid out, well written
account of the Ubuntu-sphere and all that goes along with it.</p></p>

I just tried Herd 5 of Gutsy Gibbon, a beta release which will be Ubuntu
07.10 released in October. Obviously it is still early stages and a lot
of things aren&rsquo;t working quite as they should, but it looks very
promising. Here&rsquo;s some new stuff which should hit the final release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiz Fusion - Pretty Graphics that leave you in awe&hellip;</li>
<li>Bullet Proof X - Making sure you&rsquo;ll never see a terminal prompt not
of your own choosing, basically the graphics server should be
&lsquo;bulletproof&rsquo;</li>
<li>Appearance Manager - Making it easier to change yourbuntu&rsquo;s look and
feel</li>
<li>Better Driver Support - More of those restricted drivers to make
sure you can see your screen and use your wifi card</li>
<li>Simplified Codecs install - It will now be painless, install
ubuntu-restrictedcodecs (or kubuntu-restricted codecs) and you can
see Youtube in all its glory, play a dvd, watch that porno WMV file
(just kidding but I think thats all WMV is used for) and other such
niceties of the propreitry world we have to put up with</li>
<li>Firefox Codecs Plugin - Firefox will be hooked up to the package
manager and prompt to install Flash/Java if you haven&rsquo;t got it
already, much the same way it prompts to get a codec when you throw
a file at it that it cannot play in the movie player. The free
software Gnash replacement for Flash will come as standard and can
play Youtube Vids.</li>
<li>Dual Screen Glory - If your like me you have a nice and small
portable laptop, but that screen just won&rsquo;t do all of the time,
thats why I personally have a 19&quot; to plug my 13&quot; MacBook into. With
Gutsy I should be able to plug and play over DVI.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the features that are being worked on for the
final release. Probably not all of them on the list will get into Gutsy
final, but lets hope they do! Gutsy+1 (slated for release April 2008)
has been announced as &ldquo;Hardy Hereon&rdquo; and should be a long term release
(5 years server and 3 years desktop updates and
patches).<a href="http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg" alt="image"></a></p></p>

I have been always pleased with Dells prices, how their machines work
with Linux, their customer service and the fact they are made in
Limerick, Ireland (I am from Ireland). I politely emailed Dell (well got
up on my high horse), heres my first mail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like a refund of Windows XP since I am installing Ubuntu Linux
on the computer when I get it. When I turn on the computer I am going
to decline the EULA, and I am within my rights to request this refund
(as part of Irish consumer laws). This also applies in Britian, see

I recently read a very insightful article on 7 factors every company
should seriously consider about Microsoft Windows, here they are
summarised:</p>
<ol>
<li>Licensing Costs</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating
systems and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of
money on licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S.
companies overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software
maintenance in 2007.</p></p>

                <p><p>HP it seems is responding to Dell&rsquo;s initiative to
sell Ubuntu on their computers. With the Ubuntu Dells reportedly selling
very well and Dell rolling out the program worldwide, this hasn&rsquo;t
escaped the notice of the world&rsquo;s number one computer manufacturer - HP.
This is speculation from blogs that has been going on for months since
Dell started to offer Ubuntu. The Direct to Dell Blog states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This <a href="http://tomdryer.com/blog/index.php/2007/07/03/is-hp-going-to-start-offering-ubuntu/">recent post from Tom
Dryer</a>
caught my eye a couple of days ago, and thought I&rsquo;d comment on it
here. If the rumors about HP offering Ubuntu are true, we&rsquo;re glad to
see other vendors join us in support of Ubuntu and open source. We
welcome HP and other system vendors that want to join in this
initiative.</p></p>
