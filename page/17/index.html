A jury in Chicago then found Microsoft guilty of infringing on Eolasâ€™ patents and was told to pay $521m US Dollars in &lsquo;damages&rsquo;. That ruling was overturned and a fresh trial ordered which was due to start very soon, but it seems Microsoft has decided to pay out:</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 31, 2007</time>

Obviously it is still early stages and a lot of things aren&rsquo;t working quite as they should, but it looks very promising. Here&rsquo;s some new stuff which should hit the final release:
Compiz Fusion - Pretty Graphics that leave you in awe&mldr; Bullet Proof X - Making sure you&rsquo;ll never see a terminal prompt not of your own choosing, basically the graphics server should be &lsquo;bulletproof&rsquo; Appearance Manager - Making it easier to change yourbuntu&rsquo;s look and feel Better Driver Support - More of those restricted drivers to make sure you can see your screen and use your wifi card Simplified Codecs install - It will now be painless, install ubuntu-restrictedcodecs (or kubuntu-restricted codecs) and you can see Youtube in all its glory, play a dvd, watch that porno WMV file (just kidding but I think thats all WMV is used for) and other such niceties of the propreitry world we have to put up with Firefox Codecs Plugin - Firefox will be hooked up to the package manager and prompt to install Flash/Java if you haven&rsquo;t got it already, much the same way it prompts to get a codec when you throw a file at it that it cannot play in the movie player.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 29, 2007</time>

For my Linux machines, all of them are Dell. I have been always pleased with Dells prices, how their machines work with Linux, their customer service and the fact they are made in Limerick, Ireland (I am from Ireland). I politely emailed Dell (well got up on my high horse), heres my first mail:

Lately I have been switching people to Ubuntu, and even getting them to buy machines to install it on (Dell). But I understand and have no zealotry for Linux when it comes to fixing peoples&rsquo; real world problems. I always mention Ubuntu as a matter of course, and also Macs.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 16, 2007</time>

Licensing Costs Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating systems and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of money on licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S. companies overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software maintenance in 2007.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 6, 2007</time>

With the Ubuntu Dells reportedly selling very well and Dell rolling out the program worldwide, this hasn&rsquo;t escaped the notice of the world&rsquo;s number one computer manufacturer - HP. This is speculation from blogs that has been going on for months since Dell started to offer Ubuntu. The Direct to Dell Blog states:

He says he isn&rsquo;t biased, saying he worked over 75% of his career outside Microsoft, using Slackware Linux, Unix, HP Unix etc. He claims Windows Vista has less security holes than popular versions of Linux, such as Ubuntu (he also compares Red Hat, Novell, Mac OS X). First let me say why his facts are distorted, and why he knows his facts are distorted.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 3, 2007</time>

Germany has barred the makers of a movie about a plot to kill Adolf Hitler from filming at German military sites because its star Tom Cruise is a Scientologist, the Defence Ministry said on Monday.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 26, 2007</time>

While I had seen and briefly used one before, I was excited again upon using my own one (as all tech people are [read: geeks]). First of all don&rsquo;t confuse me as anyway into photography: I&rsquo;m not and far from it. I had a criteria in mind when I purchased and this was it:
Must work under any OS (Windows [a given], Mac and Linux [latter two I only use]) Every camera I have come across mounts as a disc drive [think looking at files on a cd or your local computer], but there is also PTP or &ldquo;Picture Transfer Protocol&rdquo; in other words it doesn&rsquo;t appear as picture files, rather PTP triggers your computer to open your camera in your photo application.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 14, 2007</time>
