Introducing Ubuntu Installing Ubuntu Using Ubuntu on the Desktop Advanced Usage and Managing Ubuntu Ubuntu Server Support / Typical Problems Using Kubuntu Ubuntu Community Ubuntu-Related Projects Using Edubuntu This book is a very complete introduction and contains suprising elements related to finding out and joining the community of users - which you will not find in other Ubuntu Books (such as O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Ubuntu Hacks) which make it a unique and worthwhile addition to any Ubuntu users personal library.</p>

A jury in Chicago then found Microsoft guilty of infringing on Eolasâ€™ patents and was told to pay $521m US Dollars in &lsquo;damages&rsquo;. That ruling was overturned and a fresh trial ordered which was due to start very soon, but it seems Microsoft has decided to pay out:</p>

                <p>I just tried Herd 5 of Gutsy Gibbon, a beta release which will be Ubuntu 07.10 released in October. Obviously it is still early stages and a lot of things aren&rsquo;t working quite as they should, but it looks very promising. Here&rsquo;s some new stuff which should hit the final release:
Compiz Fusion - Pretty Graphics that leave you in awe&hellip; Bullet Proof X - Making sure you&rsquo;ll never see a terminal prompt not of your own choosing, basically the graphics server should be &lsquo;bulletproof&rsquo; Appearance Manager - Making it easier to change yourbuntu&rsquo;s look and feel Better Driver Support - More of those restricted drivers to make sure you can see your screen and use your wifi card Simplified Codecs install - It will now be painless, install ubuntu-restrictedcodecs (or kubuntu-restricted codecs) and you can see Youtube in all its glory, play a dvd, watch that porno WMV file (just kidding but I think thats all WMV is used for) and other such niceties of the propreitry world we have to put up with Firefox Codecs Plugin - Firefox will be hooked up to the package manager and prompt to install Flash/Java if you haven&rsquo;t got it already, much the same way it prompts to get a codec when you throw a file at it that it cannot play in the movie player.</p>

Licensing Costs Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating systems and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of money on licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S. companies overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software maintenance in 2007.</p>

This is speculation from blogs that has been going on for months since Dell started to offer Ubuntu. The Direct to Dell Blog states:
