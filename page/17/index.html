                <p><p>Planning to build a computer can be fun also. Researching parts, making sure
they work well together (if they are on Manufacturers QVL). Making a list of all
the parts you need is the beginning of the purchasing, assembly and then seeing
your machine in action! Lots of guides online help with the planning stage; but
nearly all are advice and tips. How do you know which is biased? Are the
benchmarks relevant to what you are building your machine for? Probably not most
of the time. If you&rsquo;re not a hardcore gamer like myself, your machine can
mid-range and cheaper than a pre-built solution, saving you money. I am using my
machine as a long term investment: I plan to have it long into the future and
just replace components. I think that could save me at least €3000 over ten
years (two €1,500 machines every 5 years, not beyond possibility) if not more. I
can also re-use perfectly good parts when my other machines have departed to
that big waste recycling plant in the sky.</p></p>

                <p><p>I found a new pastime: dismantling pc&rsquo;s. It my not sound like great fun, but its
a challenge to do it right and make sure you don&rsquo;t break your pc at the end of
it all. Nothing feels of so much relief when you see the BIOS boot up again
after ripping everything you can out and cramming it all back in. It stands to
you in developing problem solving skills, which of course employers love. It is
so much more visual than any theory, plus it is what the majority of people
like: physical objects like Lego going together. I am writing this on a computer
I stripped everything out of at the moment: a Dell 3100c, a Celeron D machine I
bought in August of last year. Today I dismantled a very old Optiplex PIII, and
the difference between the machines is marked, even though there are only a few
years between them. I have included some photos below to show the inside
internals:</p></p>

Is the much beloved Apple the new Microsoft? First there was IBM, the big all
crushing corporate machine that was humbled by the next big giant in the form of
Microsoft, so it seems Apple&rsquo;s turn is long overdue. The next few weeks are
crucial to this crossroads in which Apple finds itself: It owes a HUGE amount to
the BSD (an open source Unix clone) which is the foundation for not just OS X,
but the iPhone and now the iPod Touch. Basically without the kernel that runs
these fantastic devices, Apple would still be up shit creek without a paddle.
Granted the iPod would have been a huge success probably still, but OS X&rsquo;s core
is the foundation for the real money making Apple will do over the next few
years, a point that is not lost on Mr. Jobs as the company intelligently markets
different segments to different markets of which I have first hand experience
of: Go to the Apple site for education and they extol the brilliance of a
Macbook and make they deal sweeter by throwing in an iPod Nano. But if you go to
a link I was provided in a college advert; they bring to a page pointing out key
areas a mac can make a difference. I picked Computer Science naturally, and the
site extolled the virtues of Open Source, a Unix base and programming tools like
Xcode.</p></p>

Ubuntu Book (2nd Edition) is a nicely put together book for dealing with the
Linux operating system in a number of clearly laid out and well presented
chapters. Chapters are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introducing Ubuntu</li>
<li>Installing Ubuntu</li>
<li>Using Ubuntu on the Desktop</li>
<li>Advanced Usage and Managing Ubuntu</li>
<li>Ubuntu Server</li>
<li>Support / Typical Problems</li>
<li>Using Kubuntu</li>
<li>Ubuntu Community</li>
<li>Ubuntu-Related Projects</li>
<li>Using Edubuntu</li>
</ol>
<p>This book is a very complete introduction and contains suprising elements
related to finding out and joining the community of users - which you will not
find in other Ubuntu Books (such as O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Ubuntu Hacks) which make it a
unique and worthwhile addition to any Ubuntu users personal library. It is most
helpful to new users to Ubuntu, which sections on installing and help with
problems that could be faced. Having said that, it falls short on the amount of
truly unique information that it contains - most of the books contents can be
found on the web. What you are paying for is a well-laid out, well written
account of the Ubuntu-sphere and all that goes along with it.</p></p>

I
just tried Herd 5 of Gutsy Gibbon, a beta release which will be Ubuntu 07.10
released in October. Obviously it is still early stages and a lot of things
aren&rsquo;t working quite as they should, but it looks very promising. Here&rsquo;s some
new stuff which should hit the final release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiz Fusion - Pretty Graphics that leave you in awe&hellip;</li>
<li>Bullet Proof X - Making sure you&rsquo;ll never see a terminal prompt not of your
own choosing, basically the graphics server should be &lsquo;bulletproof&rsquo;</li>
<li>Appearance Manager - Making it easier to change yourbuntu&rsquo;s look and feel</li>
<li>Better Driver Support - More of those restricted drivers to make sure you can
see your screen and use your wifi card</li>
<li>Simplified Codecs install - It will now be painless, install
ubuntu-restrictedcodecs (or kubuntu-restricted codecs) and you can see Youtube
in all its glory, play a dvd, watch that porno WMV file (just kidding but I
think thats all WMV is used for) and other such niceties of the propreitry
world we have to put up with</li>
<li>Firefox Codecs Plugin - Firefox will be hooked up to the package manager and
prompt to install Flash/Java if you haven&rsquo;t got it already, much the same way
it prompts to get a codec when you throw a file at it that it cannot play in
the movie player. The free software Gnash replacement for Flash will come as
standard and can play Youtube Vids.</li>
<li>Dual Screen Glory - If your like me you have a nice and small portable laptop,
but that screen just won&rsquo;t do all of the time, thats why I personally have a
19&quot; to plug my 13&quot; MacBook into. With Gutsy I should be able to plug and play
over DVI.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the features that are being worked on for the final
release. Probably not all of them on the list will get into Gutsy final, but
lets hope they do! Gutsy+1 (slated for release April 2008) has been announced as
&ldquo;Hardy Hereon&rdquo; and should be a long term release (5 years server and 3 years
desktop updates and
patches).<a href="http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg" alt="image"></a></p></p>

                <p><p>I come into contact everyday with people asking how to fix their machines due to
the inevitable spyware and viruses found on a Windows machine. Lately I have
been switching people to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, and even getting them
to buy machines to install it on (<a href="http://www.dell.com/open">Dell</a>). But I
understand and have no zealotry for Linux when it comes to fixing peoples&rsquo; real
world problems. I always mention <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> as a matter of
course, and also <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac">Macs</a>. I follow up peoples Ubuntu
installs with friendly emails explaining the free help open to them, but also as
common (probably moreso) are my emailed tips to people guiding them how to fix
there Windows XP computer. So I&rsquo;ll list the steps here which are generic and
should help anyone out their with such problems; this is not a miracle cure and
I fix these problems on a case by case basis, so expect better perfromance, but
not a new computer!!</p></p>
