I
recently read a very insightful article on 7 factors every company should
seriously consider about Microsoft Windows, here they are summarised:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Licensing Costs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating systems
and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of money on
licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S. companies
overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software maintenance in 2007.</p></p>

out the program worldwide, this hasn&rsquo;t escaped the notice of the world&rsquo;s number
one computer manufacturer - HP. This is speculation from blogs that has been
going on for months since Dell started to offer Ubuntu. The Direct to Dell Blog
states:</p>

me say why his facts are distorted, and why he knows his facts are distorted.
His facts do raise an issue of slow patching of vulnerabilities across the
software Industry, but Linux performs the best consistently because anyone can
audit the code. Here&rsquo;s why his comparisons are uneven:</p></p>

<p>While some seem to be not impressed by Leopard, it is by all accounts an OS
upgrade, with every major application recieving attention. To me I am overjoyed
the finder is getting a revamp, though I am not certain following iTunes layout
is such a good idea. I think this is Steve Jobs (CEO. Apple Inc) idea to
&ldquo;switch&rdquo; windows people since they already use iTunes, although I am not sure it
is the right path. I choose Mac OS X because its unique, it has a fresh take on
how a user interacts with a computer, moreso than Linux (which adopts tried and
true in the case of Gnome and KDE), and certainly Windows which has only tweaked
the look since Windows 95: its the same concept. The fanning out of dock icons,
and grouping them won&rsquo;t be used by the vast majority of users: its the same
reason they don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;smart&rdquo; folders: its a feature that has little in the way
of wide appeal. I know the same can be said of the dashboard, and I personally
will most likely end up buying and using fanning out and collections in Leopard,
but my experience of novices is that they are afraid of the unknown.</p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>I just bought a HP Photosmart R927, an 8 Megapixel camera from Hewlett-Packard.
While I had seen and briefly used one before, I was excited again upon using my
own one (as all tech people are [read: geeks]). First of all don&rsquo;t confuse me as
anyway into photography: I&rsquo;m not and far from it. I had a criteria in mind when I
purchased and this was it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must work under any OS (Windows [a given], Mac and Linux [latter two I only use])</li>
</ul>
<p>Every camera I have come across mounts as a disc drive [think looking at
files on a cd or your local computer], but there is also PTP or &ldquo;Picture
Transfer Protocol&rdquo; in other words it doesn&rsquo;t appear as picture files, rather PTP
triggers your computer to open your camera in your photo application. I was
unsure if this PTP would work under Mac or Linux, since I had only briefly seen
it as an option in <a href="http://www.digikam.org/">digiKam</a>. It turns out on Mac there
is <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/imagecapture/">Image Capture</a>, and
Ubuntu (My Linux distribution of choice) it automatically detects it and asks to
import photos into<a href="http://f-spot.org/">F-Spot</a>.</p></p>

Some things have been around for years, but it&rsquo;s how well your software can do
it is the key. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t tout features that another competitor does
better, but thats just me. It seems irresponsible and unbelieveable the head of
a public company can say and get away with this - not knowing the competition
that is. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust my money to anyone who does not keep up with the

                <p><p>Dell Computers has started selling Ubuntu Linux 7.04 on consumer machines in the
United States. This can only be good news, as a supporter of Linux since late
2004/early 2005 I am fully behind this initiative to put Linux as a choice in
front of people who buy computers. They are testing the market at the moment
which explains why they are shipping stock drivers with the hardware, and no
multimedia codecs (which is unfortunate, but understandable that this deal was
done in 60 days). I think this is quite an achievement for Canonical and Mark
Shuttleworth (Ubuntu Founder), as they get to do the traditional Linux business
model: you pay for support, and if you don&rsquo;t need it, you don&rsquo;t buy it. This
could confuse some people in the shorter term, but long term its a winner: Dell
does what it does best (Hardware) and Software is left to Ubuntu&rsquo;s parent
company Canonical. This is opposed to Microsoft getting Dell to provide support
for both hardware and software, sometimes a messy business in which the consumer
does not know which to turn to and can often be left out in the cold. I hope
Dell extends this to Europe and 6the rest of the world soon, and makes a decent
stab at promoting a free software desktop. Dell list advantages in one of their
videos:</p></p>

is allowing the copying, remixing and free use of presidential debates as long
as they are given credit, I believe RTE should follow its lead and extend to
