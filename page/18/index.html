If you agree we should be allowed to download, remix and share the debates while giving RTE credit for production, please:

UPDATE: Poll is now closed as the leaders debates are now finished.</p>

                <p>This is the text of an email I sent to RTE. In America, CNN Television network is allowing the copying, remixing and free use of presidential debates as long as they are given credit, I believe RTE should follow its lead and extend to other programs:
 First of all, sorry this isn&rsquo;t to the right department, I couldn&rsquo;t find the right one. The technical department which runs the website would make likely be able to deal with and respond to this issue.</p>

                <p>Well this is not a technology related post, but I get asked about it alot and people have sketchy details about what it is (ie. they know my vision is messed up). Keratoconus (from Greek: kerato- horn, cornea; and konos cone), is a degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye in which structural changes within the cornea cause it to thin and change to a more conical shape than its normal gradual curve.</p>

I am not much of a gamer myself and most websites aren&rsquo;t very helpful or have too small a focus (only shoot-em-ups, or only certain Linux distros etc.). Inspired by the fine folks at OpenSourceMac.org and OpenSourceWindows.org, I announce my own project: Ultimate Games Disc. UGD is a project I think I can make very successful.</p>

These same people never admit the things Europe does right, which may well be this hopefully landslide affect against destroying DRM. To quote The Register:</p>

10. Spybot Search and Destroy
 Always a must on spyware infested Windows XP installs I come across (Unfortunately all to often). It removes a lot of the bad stuff, and my most used feature is system startup section, as I can stop all that crud from loading and slowing everything to a crawl.</p>

I looked up some of my favourite artists to see if they were part of the &ldquo;MAFIAA&rdquo; that is the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), not surprisingly some were (70% of sold music worldwide is put out by this cartel). I got rather confused when a Franz Ferdinand album appeared on the list, when their debut album did not. Seems the record label did a deal with Sony for distribution.</p>
