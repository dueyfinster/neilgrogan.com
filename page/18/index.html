<p>While some seem to be not impressed by Leopard, it is by all accounts an
OS upgrade, with every major application recieving attention. To me I am
overjoyed the finder is getting a revamp, though I am not certain
following iTunes layout is such a good idea. I think this is Steve Jobs
(CEO. Apple Inc) idea to &ldquo;switch&rdquo; windows people since they already use
iTunes, although I am not sure it is the right path. I choose Mac OS X
because its unique, it has a fresh take on how a user interacts with a
computer, moreso than Linux (which adopts tried and true in the case of
Gnome and KDE), and certainly Windows which has only tweaked the look
since Windows 95: its the same concept. The fanning out of dock icons,
and grouping them won&rsquo;t be used by the vast majority of users: its the
same reason they don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;smart&rdquo; folders: its a feature that has
little in the way of wide appeal. I know the same can be said of the
dashboard, and I personally will most likely end up buying and using
fanning out and collections in Leopard, but my experience of novices is
that they are afraid of the unknown.</p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>I just bought a HP Photosmart R927, an 8 Megapixel camera from
Hewlett-Packard. While I had seen and briefly used one before, I was
excited again upon using my own one (as all tech people are [read:
geeks]). First of all don&rsquo;t confuse me as anyway into photography: I&rsquo;m
not and far from it. I had a criteria in mind when I purchased and this
was it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must work under any OS (Windows [a given], Mac and Linux [latter two
I only use])</li>
</ul>
<p>Every camera I have come across mounts as a disc drive [think looking at
files on a cd or your local computer], but there is also PTP or &ldquo;Picture
Transfer Protocol&rdquo; in other words it doesn&rsquo;t appear as picture files,
rather PTP triggers your computer to open your camera in your photo
application. I was unsure if this PTP would work under Mac or Linux,
since I had only briefly seen it as an option in
<a href="http://www.digikam.org/">digiKam</a>. It turns out on Mac there is <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/imagecapture/">Image
Capture</a>, and Ubuntu
(My Linux distribution of choice) it automatically detects it and asks
to import photos into<a href="http://f-spot.org/">F-Spot</a>.</p></p>

Apple has been shipping everything he mentions since 2005, and I have
tried Vista, it doesn&rsquo;t even surpass Apples&rsquo; attempt at the software
(which should be his aim). Some things have been around for years, but
it&rsquo;s how well your software can do it is the key. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t
tout features that another competitor does better, but thats just me. It
seems irresponsible and unbelieveable the head of a public company can
say and get away with this - not knowing the competition that is. I
wouldn&rsquo;t trust my money to anyone who does not keep up with the latest
and greatest trends in the industry.</p></p>

            <div>
                <p><p>Dell Computers has started
selling Ubuntu Linux 7.04 on consumer machines in the United States.
This can only be good news, as a supporter of Linux since late
2004/early 2005 I am fully behind this initiative to put Linux as a
choice in front of people who buy computers. They are testing the market
at the moment which explains why they are shipping stock drivers with
the hardware, and no multimedia codecs (which is unfortunate, but
understandable that this deal was done in 60 days). I think this is
quite an achievement for Canonical and Mark Shuttleworth (Ubuntu
Founder), as they get to do the traditional Linux business model: you
pay for support, and if you don&rsquo;t need it, you don&rsquo;t buy it. This could
confuse some people in the shorter term, but long term its a winner:
Dell does what it does best (Hardware) and Software is left to Ubuntu&rsquo;s
parent company Canonical. This is opposed to Microsoft getting Dell to
provide support for both hardware and software, sometimes a messy
business in which the consumer does not know which to turn to and can
often be left out in the cold. I hope Dell extends this to Europe and
6the rest of the world soon, and makes a decent stab at promoting a free
software desktop. Dell list advantages in one of their videos:</p></p>

this is not a technology related post, but I get asked about it alot and
people have sketchy details about what it is (ie. they know my vision is
messed up). <strong>Keratoconus</strong> (from Greek: <em>kerato-</em> horn, cornea; and
<em>konos</em> cone), is a degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye in
which structural changes within the cornea cause it to thin and change
to a more conical shape than its normal gradual curve. In plain English,
light bends in a distorted way to make vision ghosted, blurry and less
sharp. Glasses cannot fix this problem as they fix issues with your
natural lense behind the cornea, as usually it has improper focus.</p></p>

                <p><p>I got inspiration over this past Easter holidays, being bored, I gave
Linux Gaming a shot. I am not much of a gamer myself and most websites
aren&rsquo;t very helpful or have too small a focus (only shoot-em-ups, or
only certain Linux distros etc.). Inspired by the fine folks at
OpenSourceMac.org and OpenSourceWindows.org, I announce my own project:

hour before it was announced: Apple and EMI are going Digital Rights
Management (DRM) free, albeit at a slightly higher cost and quality. One
of my pet hates is people who bash the European Union, often citing I
will admit its not glowing charachteristics. These same people never
admit the things <em>Europe does right</em>, which may well be this hopefully

Destroy</em></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Always a must on spyware infested Windows XP installs I come across
(Unfortunately all to often). It removes a lot of the bad stuff, and my
most used feature is system startup section, as I can stop all that crud
from loading and slowing everything to a crawl.</li>
