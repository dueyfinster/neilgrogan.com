Now Apple has been shipping everything he mentions since 2005, and I have tried Vista, it doesn&rsquo;t even surpass Apples&rsquo; attempt at the software (which should be his aim). Some things have been around for years, but it&rsquo;s how well your software can do it is the key. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t tout features that another competitor does better, but thats just me.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 29, 2007</time>

This can only be good news, as a supporter of Linux since late 2004/early 2005 I am fully behind this initiative to put Linux as a choice in front of people who buy computers. They are testing the market at the moment which explains why they are shipping stock drivers with the hardware, and no multimedia codecs (which is unfortunate, but understandable that this deal was done in 60 days).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 26, 2007</time>

If you agree we should be allowed to download, remix and share the debates while giving RTE credit for production, please:
Sign the Petition!
UPDATE: Poll is now closed as the leaders debates are now finished.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 17, 2007</time>

In America, CNN Television network is allowing the copying, remixing and free use of presidential debates as long as they are given credit, I believe RTE should follow its lead and extend to other programs:
First of all, sorry this isn&rsquo;t to the right department, I couldn&rsquo;t find the right one. The technical department which runs the website would make likely be able to deal with and respond to this issue.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 6, 2007</time>

Keratoconus (from Greek: kerato- horn, cornea; and konos cone), is a degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye in which structural changes within the cornea cause it to thin and change to a more conical shape than its normal gradual curve.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 6, 2007</time>

I am not much of a gamer myself and most websites aren&rsquo;t very helpful or have too small a focus (only shoot-em-ups, or only certain Linux distros etc.). Inspired by the fine folks at OpenSourceMac.org and OpenSourceWindows.org, I announce my own project: Ultimate Games Disc. UGD is a project I think I can make very successful.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 16, 2007</time>

One of my pet hates is people who bash the European Union, often citing I will admit its not glowing charachteristics. These same people never admit the things Europe does right, which may well be this hopefully landslide affect against destroying DRM.

My Top 10 Apps of 2007 in descending order:
10. Spybot Search and Destroy
Always a must on spyware infested Windows XP installs I come across (Unfortunately all to often). It removes a lot of the bad stuff, and my most used feature is system startup section, as I can stop all that crud from loading and slowing everything to a crawl.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 1, 2007</time>

It was recorded on my Mac, so unfortunately its Mac specific, but really only iSquint program is, so if anyone can suggest a replacement on Windows or Linux, I will add it to the details of the video. I use Garageband for audio, iMovieHD to edit the video and audio and Copernicus to record my screen.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 11, 2007</time>
