                <p><p>Well I think so! Got one there 2 months ago and forgot to write a blog post
about it. I got a &lsquo;01 model for a bargain price I believe; but this theory has
yet to be tested (I&rsquo;ll wait for a year to be up). As I mentioned before in
previous posts my parent&rsquo;s house is now in a remote location with no train/buses
anywhere nearby. So transport was essential! At this time also there was a major
crack down on learner drivers not being accompanied by a fully licensed driver
(of two years). So by the time I&rsquo;d saved the money for the car; got 10 lessons
and convinced anyone I knew with over two years full driving experience to
accompany me; even to work - was just to much hassle - hence the moped which has
no such onerous requirements. In fact only one it does really have is that you
can&rsquo;t have passengers - I won&rsquo;t be carrying anyone anyways - so I am not too
bothered. Anyhoo take a look at the photos I took when I got it. I have done it
up since then: new tyres, resprayed exhaust, full service; new mirrors; repaired
exhaust; flushed out radiator and put in proper coolant just to name a few. So
it sounds allot better and drives better than ever!</p></p>

much to report hence lack of Tech posts. Sure the iPhone 3G looks good,
Google/Yahoo/Microsoft spats interesting but after a while it become a bit
circular and repetitive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started working at the UK&rsquo;s leading retailer for touring/car/bike
and accessories; as well as a move to the south east of Ireland; that much
further to the capital: Dublin. It&rsquo;s Ireland&rsquo;s smallest city and home to
Ireland&rsquo;s very first Parliament about 400 years ago: Kilkenny. It&rsquo;s steeped in
culture and it&rsquo;s the only city in Ireland to rival Dublin&rsquo;s culture, nightlife
and restaurants and hold it&rsquo;s own.</p></p>

get this out of the way: I had a Frappacino in Starbucks and I&rsquo;m a student; so
not too poor of a student ;)</p>
<p>But I saw the inside of Brown Thomas for the first time. I don&rsquo;t shop for
fashion at all: but what I found was the kind of vulgarity and fake-ness I&rsquo;d
expect of London or New York; not Dublin. To paraphrase Bono: &ldquo;In America if you
have your mansion on a hill people look up to you and think &lsquo;I want to be like
him and afford a house like that one day&rsquo;; if you have the same mansion in
Ireland people say &rsquo;look at the fucken eejit on the hill with that house; thinks
he&rsquo;s god or sumthen&rsquo;&rdquo; and that to me was always an endearing part of Irish
culture; people around you being the great leveller if you thought you were the
bomb. Inside BT (Brown Thomas) was all the names you&rsquo;d expect; all the major
names more at home in Paris, London or New York. I confronted my friend who was
showing me round about my opinions (in my usual polite manner: just say it). To
my surprise he agreed 110%. Yes he said: for the people who buy this stuff can
tell who else is wearing it; and I think he meant that by this logic movers and
shakers also wore all the brands to look the part. Soon after he told me he was
also learning Golf because he knew it would be a great benefit for his future
career: &ldquo;All important people also play golf&rdquo; he assured me.</p></p>

<a href="http://www.google.ie/">Google</a> is muling over taking Skype off of Ebay&rsquo;s hands.
Ebay has already written down the value of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">Skype</a> as a large loss on their purchase
price of $2.6 billion in stock and cash. But
w<a href="http://about.skype.com/online.png"><img src="http://about.skype.com/online.png" alt="image"></a>ould
Skype&rsquo;s G-branded future be any better?</p>
<p>I think it would be. Skype is a strong international brand for voice calls,
instant messaging and video calls; but of course it competes directly with
Google Talk. Skype as a company has made a lot of mistakes; but they actually
produces some of the best technology for p2p VOIP out there in the marketplace.
Skype is particularly strong in redundancy, cost of network operation (since
it&rsquo;s p2p every user carries&rsquo; each others traffic; most people have no idea of
this fact) and routing around the most draconian network admins out their
through their routers.</p></p>

What makes it so good? Have you ever heard of Amarok? Chances are if your an OS

busy porting it from it&rsquo;s UNIX underpinnings to Windows and OS X.<br>

when details were only starting to filter out. It wasn&rsquo;t expected for Nokia to
introduce an upgrade to the

certainly don&rsquo;t envy the position of a small team getting the hardware and
software for a mini-computer right in such a short space of time. But needless
to say the N810 feels right; in fact it feels more right than the N770 which I
thought had the best design of all (be it functionality not so much style). The
N810 has bags of style; in a flashy brand-new-car sort of way; it looks
expensive and I believe Nokia plays to this in their pricing.</p></p>

suspect its called that because it is more of an incremental upgrade than a
total visual refresh it was going from an Nokia 770 to N800. Here it is:</p>

<p>(Picture Courtesy:
<a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/10/17/the-nokia-n810-internet-tablet/">Internet Tablet Talk</a>)</p>
<p>It sports a nice new hardware keyboard; inbuilt GPS (For satellite mapping) and
OS 2008 (an upgrade to the operating system it runs). The N800 will also benefit
from OS 2008, which will include GoogleTalk, Skype, Mozilla browser, among the
usual such as its email client, media player, file manager, control panel,
assorted games and an image/PDF viewer. The one feature it will emit is an
inbuilt FM Radio, which was axed to make the N810 a smaller tablet. It still
retains the best screen size for web browsing, bluetooth connectivity, and of
course Wifi which is central to the tablets existance! No word on what easter
eggs are included if any; on the N800 it was a radio and the N770 it was the
microphone.
