<a href="http://www.google.ie/">Google</a> is muling over taking Skype off of Ebay&rsquo;s hands.
Ebay has already written down the value of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">Skype</a> as a large loss on their purchase
price of $2.6 billion in stock and cash. But
w<a href="http://about.skype.com/online.png"><img src="http://about.skype.com/online.png" alt="image"></a>ould
Skype&rsquo;s G-branded future be any better?</p>
<p>I think it would be. Skype is a strong international brand for voice calls,
instant messaging and video calls; but of course it competes directly with
Google Talk. Skype as a company has made a lot of mistakes; but they actually
produces some of the best technology for p2p VOIP out there in the marketplace.
Skype is particularly strong in redundancy, cost of network operation (since
it&rsquo;s p2p every user carries&rsquo; each others traffic; most people have no idea of
this fact) and routing around the most draconian network admins out their
through their routers.</p></p>

when details were only starting to filter out. It wasn&rsquo;t expected for Nokia to
introduce an upgrade to the

certainly don&rsquo;t envy the position of a small team getting the hardware and
software for a mini-computer right in such a short space of time. But needless
to say the N810 feels right; in fact it feels more right than the N770 which I
thought had the best design of all (be it functionality not so much style). The
N810 has bags of style; in a flashy brand-new-car sort of way; it looks
expensive and I believe Nokia plays to this in their pricing.</p></p>

                <p><p>Nokia have announced an upgrade to the N800 Internet tablet, called the N810. I
suspect its called that because it is more of an incremental upgrade than a
total visual refresh it was going from an Nokia 770 to N800. Here it is:</p>

<p>(Picture Courtesy:
<a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/10/17/the-nokia-n810-internet-tablet/">Internet Tablet Talk</a>)</p>
<p>It sports a nice new hardware keyboard; inbuilt GPS (For satellite mapping) and
OS 2008 (an upgrade to the operating system it runs). The N800 will also benefit
from OS 2008, which will include GoogleTalk, Skype, Mozilla browser, among the
usual such as its email client, media player, file manager, control panel,
assorted games and an image/PDF viewer. The one feature it will emit is an
inbuilt FM Radio, which was axed to make the N810 a smaller tablet. It still
retains the best screen size for web browsing, bluetooth connectivity, and of
course Wifi which is central to the tablets existance! No word on what easter
eggs are included if any; on the N800 it was a radio and the N770 it was the
microphone.

payday. The logical step is to go after the biggest infringer to set a precedent
for your patent, and then make your way to all the smaller companies who
infringe. Well logically of course that would be Apple or Microsoft. Apple has
already paid them a reported 20 million dollars, and well no-one knows what
Microsoft has done, but this fish is smelly. From the Register Article:</p></p>

they work well together (if they are on Manufacturers QVL). Making a list of all
the parts you need is the beginning of the purchasing, assembly and then seeing
your machine in action! Lots of guides online help with the planning stage; but
nearly all are advice and tips. How do you know which is biased? Are the
benchmarks relevant to what you are building your machine for? Probably not most
of the time. If you&rsquo;re not a hardcore gamer like myself, your machine can
mid-range and cheaper than a pre-built solution, saving you money. I am using my
machine as a long term investment: I plan to have it long into the future and
just replace components. I think that could save me at least €3000 over ten
years (two €1,500 machines every 5 years, not beyond possibility) if not more. I
can also re-use perfectly good parts when my other machines have departed to
that big waste recycling plant in the sky.</p></p>

a challenge to do it right and make sure you don&rsquo;t break your pc at the end of
it all. Nothing feels of so much relief when you see the BIOS boot up again
after ripping everything you can out and cramming it all back in. It stands to
you in developing problem solving skills, which of course employers love. It is
so much more visual than any theory, plus it is what the majority of people
like: physical objects like Lego going together. I am writing this on a computer
I stripped everything out of at the moment: a Dell 3100c, a Celeron D machine I
bought in August of last year. Today I dismantled a very old Optiplex PIII, and
the difference between the machines is marked, even though there are only a few

Is the much beloved Apple the new Microsoft? First there was IBM, the big all
crushing corporate machine that was humbled by the next big giant in the form of
Microsoft, so it seems Apple&rsquo;s turn is long overdue. The next few weeks are
crucial to this crossroads in which Apple finds itself: It owes a HUGE amount to
the BSD (an open source Unix clone) which is the foundation for not just OS X,
but the iPhone and now the iPod Touch. Basically without the kernel that runs
these fantastic devices, Apple would still be up shit creek without a paddle.
Granted the iPod would have been a huge success probably still, but OS X&rsquo;s core
is the foundation for the real money making Apple will do over the next few
years, a point that is not lost on Mr. Jobs as the company intelligently markets
different segments to different markets of which I have first hand experience
of: Go to the Apple site for education and they extol the brilliance of a
Macbook and make they deal sweeter by throwing in an iPod Nano. But if you go to
a link I was provided in a college advert; they bring to a page pointing out key
areas a mac can make a difference. I picked Computer Science naturally, and the
site extolled the virtues of Open Source, a Unix base and programming tools like
Xcode.</p></p>
