it got me thinking what would it take for me to buy one? I haven&rsquo;t bought the
first generation iPad because the lack of a camera on a device so obviously good
for fullscreen video calls has baffled me. I guess they have to store up some
ideas since they need a new hardware iteration every year, Apple&rsquo;s revenue model
depends on that vital hardware refresh cycle.</p></p>

the realisation there can&rsquo;t be anything added, or can there?</p></p>

had two mobile GPS&rsquo; units before (one being Nokia N800 with Bluetooth external

<a href="http://www.twit.tv/floss120">A recent episode</a> covered
<a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/">Haiku</a> - an open source operating system based on the
design of the old BeOS. What&rsquo;s very interesting about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS">BeOS</a> is the design, an integrated all in
one operating system - and the fact Apple almost purchased it. That&rsquo;s amazing to
me, literally in one fell swoop, if Apple had of offered the 200 million Be
Systems wanted, there would be no NextStep into Apple and by extension - Steve
Jobs. It&rsquo;s especially poignant since Apple just surpassed Microsoft to become
the second most valuable American company.</p></p>

(Almost) everyone that I know of donates to charity on a regular enough basis.
I&rsquo;m a college student so I don&rsquo;t donate as much as I should. But it really
annoys me how the &ldquo;main&rdquo; charities run a campaign of guilt and spend
<strong>millions</strong> on it. I&rsquo;ve donated money to all of these charities, the third
world aid charities. All of them spend far too much on paying people commission
and advertising. One that I can think of off hand is asking people who donated
more than €250 to sign a form and send it back.</p></p>

built specifically for creating 3D representations and models. Being a lover of
Open Source, when we we’re told although Blender was considered, it fell a bit
short for some reason, so we had to use 3DS Max.</p>
<p>3DS Max is not bad to use, some of the tools are nice if your not an arty type
(like me) and prefer more technical and structured things. Some of the effects
(like glass and water) give a really nice effect to add to the model your
designing. Also as part of the project we had to have an accompanying website,
