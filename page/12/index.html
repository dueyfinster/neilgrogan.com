It is a 400cc V-Twin 1991 model, with 33BHP / 24.6Kw out of the factory. That put&rsquo;s it under the legal limit for a learner motorcycle in the A category of license in Ireland. I&rsquo;ve been progressing through bikes, slowly gaining confidence and experience. I posted about my Yamaha YQ50, My Yamaha YP125 (Majesty) and now it&rsquo;s a Honda BROS&rsquo; turn!</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 24, 2010</time>

I&rsquo;d like to thank Mark and James, my team members, for all their hard work! The subject of Bauhaus was previously discussed in my graphical representation of a 3D chess set. The music is courtesy of Jamendo, and is free ;) Enjoy it the video!
Update: Also noticed Mark has a nice post on it also</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 3, 2010</time>

(Almost) everyone that I know of donates to charity on a regular enough basis. I&rsquo;m a college student so I don&rsquo;t donate as much as I should. But it really annoys me how the &ldquo;main&rdquo; charities run a campaign of guilt and spend millions on it. I&rsquo;ve donated money to all of these charities, the third world aid charities.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 1, 2010</time>

Being a lover of Open Source, when we weâ€™re told although Blender was considered, it fell a bit short for some reason, so we had to use 3DS Max.
3DS Max is not bad to use, some of the tools are nice if your not an arty type (like me) and prefer more technical and structured things.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 17, 2010</time>

For me it has never mattered someone&rsquo;s gender - I love using, tweaking and learning about computers and if you share that interest - the more, the better! It has been shown very young children are conditioned from a very young age by gender rules - shown by Prof.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 9, 2010</time>

So I am making a list of technology resolutions:
Learn C in XCode on a Mac Make an awesome CRM program for College degree (Python, Google App Engine) Learn Vim and Emacs bindings, using them for code Learn to use Git, possibly mercurial Learn some Obj-C with Cocoa Learn some C++ with Qt Learn Python +Tcl/tk Learn more about the design of Linux kernel and study some of it&rsquo;s code Do Sysadmin stuff on my server on Linode; like setting upSendmail,IRCServers and other stuff If I have time, investigate CakePHP, Django, maybe Ruby (on Rails?</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 4, 2010</time>

The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>December 7, 2009</time>
