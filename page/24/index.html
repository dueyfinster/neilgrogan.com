is now a wiki based on Wikipedias engine, metawiki. I had a load of problems
with making the theme work with a wiki with loads of menus. I think I did well
considering I only spent about 3 days doing it. The code still aint how I want
it and some features were lost, such as rss and del.icio.us bookmarks. But pages
are now easier than ever to navigate and comment on which brings more features.</p></p>

tell you what I am looking forward to in 2006. The year was firmly in the hands
of mother nature as we saw in both Pakistan, New Orleans/Gulf of Mexico and the
Tsunami’s after effects. International consensus was reached at the G8 as London
was being bombed - not by the IRA, but by their new enemies in the middle east.
Iran esculated its pressure on the world by resuming its nuclear activities.
George W. Bush took office in January, much to the distaste of the Daily Mirror
in the UK, who scored their most famous headline, “How Could 59,054,087 People,
Be So Dumb?”.</p></p>

program for the BBC. It broadcasts on the Internet and can be viewed even on a

first saw it on BBC World, while holidaying in Portugal. It also broadcasts on
BBC News 24 at 7am on a Sunday morning (I have never seen it at this time!).
Although by its nature a technical program, it is very much aimed at the average
PC user and so most things are explained fully.</p></p>

There are a couple of reasons why I like it, mainly because it is available to
upload your videos on all platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) and is available on
Mozilla-based browsers (Firefox, Netscape), Opera and Internet Explorer.This is
important in creating a better all round user experience. If only Yahoo! would
follow Googles example and open up Launch Cast to other browsers besides an
outdated version of Netscape and Internet Explorer.</p></p>

pure magic! The features are great, it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Browser (Opera)</li>
<li>Flash Player version 6</li>
<li>Email Client</li>
<li>Internet Radio</li>
<li>News Reader</li>
<li>Media players, Image viewer</li>
<li>PDF viewer</li>

<li>Search</li>
<li>Calculator</li>
<li>World Clock</li>
<li>Notes</li>
<li>Sketch</li>
<li>Games</li>
</ul>
<p>It runs on Linux, making it totally extendable. It even has its own developer
site at maemo.org, where applications can be downloaded. Hot on my list were
Doom (the Game) and GAIM (Instant Messenger, uses Google Talk, AOL, MSN, Yahoo,
Jabber, IRC, etc). Unfortunately their is no Skype for Nokia 770 just yet, but
hopefully it will be here soon. Nokia has promised an upgrade in 2006, that will
include VOIP, such as skype.</p></p>

faults and cracks. But I love freedom of the press and like organisations who
uphold basic journalistic standards, such as the BBC. This leads me onto the
evil man behind it all, Rupert Murdoch owner of The Sun, BSkyB Television, The
Times and other media outlets. It seems all he pushes is his agenda, whether it
be the Bush Right-Christian agenda on Fox in the US or Eurosceptic view in his
British interests.</p></p>

MicroSystems and make a new opensource OS, it will be based on Ubuntu. Microsoft
will purchase AOL and roll out its products on the Web, such as MS Office, it
will have a slow start to Vista, but it will pick up through peoples eagerness
to buy the latest hardware. Google will buy Opera, invest in Mozilla and
consolidate Opera into Mozilla, it will also buy Adobe (for their PDF format),
get its way to publish an online bookstore through Google Book Search. Yahoo
will continue to buy extra companies to add to its list of a zillion services,
such as Flickr and Del.icio.us.</p></p>
