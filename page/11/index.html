                <p>I purchased the iPhone 4 shortly after its release in Summer 2010. I have obviously been so quick to review this device, the iPhone 5 is upon us! My philosophy for reviewing items is you have to live with them. Well boy have I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do marvel at how good the hardware is. I&rsquo;ve dropped this extremely expensive device on occasions too numerous to count, so luckily it is designed well.</p>

                <p>A multitude of websites have been reporting the impending doom of ipv4 exhaustion, which is going to happen soon. All the top level address&rsquo; will be gone, but the regional registries will still have stocks of address&rsquo; in to 2011. As a user of ipv6, I thought I could share sone thoughts/insights on the events ahead&hellip;
Below is a very good video which one of my favourite tech shows, Hak5 made with an IPv6 Consultant, Joe Klein.</p>

It hasn&rsquo;t been updated recently I have been changing hosts with it Let me explain both of these! I have been searching for a good blogging engine ever since I have started blogging. I have yet to find the perfect one :) Some have come close in completeness (WordPress) or price and ease of use (blogger), but none has been all-encompassing. I messed around with a blogging engine called Jekyll about a year and a half ago, but I never ended up deploying it.</p>

Adblock
Blocks ads just like Firefox extension and makes the web less junky to look at. You can whitelist good ads, and an argument could be had your harming websites revenue stream, but a lot of nasty tricks such as spyware, malware have used ads as a vector to spread. Not least the dishonesty some sites use in splitting up articles in to 10 pages to pump ad revenue.</p>

I haven&rsquo;t bought the first generation iPad because the lack of a camera on a device so obviously good for fullscreen video calls has baffled me. I guess they have to store up some ideas since they need a new hardware iteration every year, Apple&rsquo;s revenue model depends on that vital hardware refresh cycle.</p>

So I asked myself, is their anything new we can learn, while I was listening to the Prodigy classic� Breathe.</p>

I thought I&rsquo;d give it a run-down for potential buyers on my experience for the first week. Firstly I should mention, I&rsquo;ve never owned another Garmin unit, and had two mobile GPS&rsquo; units before (one being Nokia N800 with Bluetooth external GPS and other Apple iPhone 3G). The reason I bring this up is that a lot of the reviews I&rsquo;ve seen written compare it to it&rsquo;s predecessor, Zumo 550, which obviously I can&rsquo;t do.</p>
