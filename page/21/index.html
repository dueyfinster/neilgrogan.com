Vodafone Ireland. I did a short video test, maybe this could be the start of my
VideoBlogging career:</p>
<p>Well maybe not! But I do hope to have more videos on my blog! The video is of me
describing my living quarters and about my laptop. I needed to be a bit closer
to the phone as hearing me is difficult sometimes (not so in real life!), but
basically I just point out what you see and explain the phone won&rsquo;t sync
address+calendar with my macbook :-( (My old phone did just that :-) ). I don&rsquo;t
really mind, bluetooth works a charm and I can exchange files between it. All I
need now is a super 2GB mini memory card, for some quick music on the go!</p></p>

This means the computer sitting in my house should be reachable worldwide at

solution to a large music catalogue such as mine. It means (for those who can
login :-) ) that my whole collection is streamable, downloadable, rateable and
generally all round goodness and what you&rsquo;d expect from a top class open source
media+web application! I am excited about this, as I have already tried it from
a remote family members house. Unfortunately it does not work too well half way
across the world in the US (speed is *really* slow I have been gleefully
informed), but I am not too bothered, upgrades in speed will come with better
broadband (which may be years, this is Ireland). I am trying to restrict peoples
usage of it at the moment, as I really do not want a letter from my Internet
Service Provider!</p></p>

<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.mactivate.ie/">Mactivate</a> got it wrong, it wasn&rsquo;t the
heatsink, <a href="../../2006/11/01/macbook-issue-identified.html">as referred to by my earlier post</a>. Looks like I have seen good
advice from the Web, never buy a first generation <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> product, until they
work out the kinks! I guess Mactivate have been snowed under with heatsink
problems, that they never bothered to check other parts of my Macbook, since it
is such a common problem.They have ordered me a new &ldquo;logic board&rdquo; (I am guessing
the <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319">PMU</a> like I thought it was ;-) ). In other news <a href="http://www.macfixit.com/article.php/2006110107475681#">Apple released a
firmware update</a> for those poor unfortunates that have been suffering Random
Shutdown Syndrome (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)">RSS</a>) for short :-D ). Hopefully I should have it back
by this Tuesday (November 7th) plus a new heatsink and logic board&hellip;. fingers
crossed anyway!</p></p>

Unit (<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319">PMU</a>), it was the heatsink. <a href="http://www.mactivate.ie/">Mactivate</a> have informed me they have
one on order from <a href="http://www.apple.ie/">Apple</a>, so it will take a bit longer than I anticipated to
get my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">Macbook</a> back. I found this strange as I had not experienced random
shutdowns like the ones that have been widely reported across the web. it was
like I described in my earlier post, something to do with the battery not being
able to charge. Then again, I am no expert on this and their is wide evidence
(over 1600 people have identified heatsink as a problem in their Macbooks) that
the heatsink is a definite issue. Sounds like good or bad I will have a lot more
to say about Apple Computer in the future, thats why I have decided to add them
as a category.</p></p>

<p>Seems even the IE team knows that IE is dead.</p>
<p>As for the ex-lax, bugs, pubes in the cake of course none of that is true.
Those things would only be possible if someone at Microsoft actually made the
cake, and that&rsquo;s not how MS does things. They knew they couldn&rsquo;t make a good
cake so they just went out and bought a cake from someone who already knew how
to make one and then stuck their logo on it and called it theirs.</p></p>
