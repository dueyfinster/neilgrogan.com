<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.mactivate.ie/">Mactivate</a> got it wrong, it wasn&rsquo;t the
heatsink, <a href="../../2006/11/01/macbook-issue-identified.html">as referred to by my earlier post</a>. Looks like I have seen good
advice from the Web, never buy a first generation <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> product, until
they work out the kinks! I guess Mactivate have been snowed under with
heatsink problems, that they never bothered to check other parts of my
Macbook, since it is such a common problem.They have ordered me a new &ldquo;logic
board&rdquo; (I am guessing the <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319">PMU</a> like I thought it was ;-) ). In other news
<a href="http://www.macfixit.com/article.php/2006110107475681#">Apple released a firmware update</a> for those poor unfortunates that have
been suffering Random Shutdown Syndrome (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)">RSS</a>) for short :-D ).
Hopefully I should have it back by this Tuesday (November 7th) plus a new
heatsink and logic board&hellip;. fingers crossed anyway!</p></p>

Unit (<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319">PMU</a>), it was the heatsink. <a href="http://www.mactivate.ie/">Mactivate</a> have informed me they have
one on order from <a href="http://www.apple.ie/">Apple</a>, so it will take a bit longer than I anticipated
to get my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">Macbook</a> back. I found this strange as I had not experienced
random shutdowns like the ones that have been widely reported across the web.
it was like I described in my earlier post, something to do with the battery
not being able to charge. Then again, I am no expert on this and their is wide
evidence (over 1600 people have identified heatsink as a problem in their
Macbooks) that the heatsink is a definite issue. Sounds like good or bad I
will have a lot more to say about Apple Computer in the future, thats why I
have decided to add them as a category.</p></p>

<p>Seems even the IE team knows that IE is dead.</p>
<p>As for the ex-lax, bugs, pubes in the cake of course none of that is
true. Those things would only be possible if someone at Microsoft
actually made the cake, and that&rsquo;s not how MS does things. They knew
they couldn&rsquo;t make a good cake so they just went out and bought a cake
from someone who already knew how to make one and then stuck their

thinking, as I really struggled to read this page being marginally away from

all fonts in my blog, in an effort to make them more readable&hellip; I encourage
everyone to do the same, or at least follow the [web standards][] so that it

my <a href="http://www.opensource.org/" title="Open Source">Open Source</a>/<a href="http://www.fsf.org/" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software</a> ways? No, definately 100% NOT. I’ll
explain why: I think Apple Computer has an incredible product in Mac OSx. For
anyone who has not used it before, pop into a 3G store and ask to have a go.
When someone releases a good a product as that, they deserve money, in my
opinion. Under “the” free software license (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt" title="GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a>) it
is permissable for anyone to charge for software licensed under it, as long as
an offer of source code is given (for 3 years afterwards). Deep down I love
<a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/" title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu</a>, and I will install it as soon as possible when they release a
version for the Intel powered Apple computers. In fact I will use my Laptop to
showcase Ubuntu you had of told me November last year I’d spend well over
€1,000 on an <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>, I would have told you that I hated Apple, and
would never consider it! What has changed my mind? I got a iPod Nano for
Christmas ‘05 and thought it was great, but the Nano on its own still wouldn’t
convince me to get a Mac.</p></p>
