great detail how open source works and the myriad of open source projects around
Tor in this talk:</p>

how they have combatted some censorship (interesting for the technical measures
deployed):</p></p>

<a href="http://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a>. If your a talk radio fan like
me, you&rsquo;ll really appreciate this app! Ever since I switched from an iPhone 4 to
a Galaxy S3 and stopped using Apple&rsquo;s Podcast application it has been
frustrating to keep up to date with podcasts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used BeyondPod on Android (which I&rsquo;ve praised before - excellent Google
Reader integration). I then tried to search for a third party podcast
application on the iPad that would synchronise with Google Reader. First there
were none, then some (like Feedler and Instacast) but all have been
bitterly disappointing with Google Reader integration. Instacast could
import OPML (after a messy bundling of feeds in Google Reader) and Feedler could
read the feeds (but not handle the video and audio contained within
the feed item properly). To be honest I&rsquo;d given up hope, I said to myself I&rsquo;d
chalk it up to fate and just buy a Nexus tablet when the iPad 2 was no longer
serviceable. But - happily - I was wrong and had been looking in the wrong
places&hellip;</p></p>

<p>In 2002, the British Film Institute depicted popcorn as &ldquo;the most profitable

the popcorn we eat costs less to produce than the very container it comes

<p>Further research indicates that isn&rsquo;t quite true - antimatter is the most
expensive substance in the world. But for a common, everyday item, it&rsquo;s very
expensive indeed. There&rsquo;s a lot less risk in production then Heroin and a lot
bigger market the Plutonium, for instance.<br /></p></p>

for Mac OS X as a desktop and how he used to feel guilty about it (given his very
impressive open source credentials).</p>
<p>I used to feel the same also. Android even as a platform more closely follows my
ideals, yet I am exclusively an avid iOS user at this point. But as I&rsquo;ve learned
more, the importance of pragmatism is clear. I use my personal iOS devices for
countless hours a day and I really just want them to work. I want them to work
in the way they were designed to do: quickly check email, browse the web, make

can&rsquo;t add much more then the extensive coverage that it has recieved in the
press to date. Instead I paraphrase really badly a friend of mine, Noel Hudson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that book thought me was dropping acid and treating people really badly
works as a life strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While that&rsquo;s not entirely true it is a humourous look at the books tone. It has
a grain of truth, Walter Issacson really focuses on the warts and all
representation of Steve Jobs. He defines him very much in terms of how other
people percieved him, whether that should have been the mainstay of the book is
up for debate. Overall it&rsquo;s a good book, what I liked most is the history
lessons of the creation of the mac and how the Disney/Pixar relationship went
down before the merger. I also felt Walter Issacson left it hanging at the end
and that he knows much more that he can&rsquo;t publish due to Apple&rsquo;s corporate
strategy being tied to Jobs so much (like the comment he made about cracking the
UI for a TV).</p></p>

<h3 id="iphone-dock">iPhone dock</h3>
<img src="../../files/2012/07/iphone.png" alt="iPhone homescreen" />
<ul>
<li><em>Phone app</em>: pretty self explanatory</li>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Still the best mobile browser I think (though if Google ever gets
going on a proper Chrome browser for Android that may change)</li>
<li><em>Tweetbot</em>: I like Twitter the most of the social networks and tweetbot is the
Swiss army knife if twitter clients</li>
<li><em>Music</em> (aka. iPod app) : I use my iPhone in my car and sometimes at work to
listen to music</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ipad-dock">iPad dock</h3>
<img src="../../files/2012/07/ipad.png" alt="iPhone homescreen" />
<ul>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Safari on iPad is not as good as the iPhone version - it can be more
full featured I think!</li>
<li><em>Mail app</em>: E-mail on the iPad is one of the most popular uses, it&rsquo;s got just
the right amount of screen real-estate to do it justice</li>
<li><em>Photography folder</em>: I don&rsquo;t know why I mistook myself as being interested in
photography, but here&rsquo;s a folder I almost never use (bar camera app)</li>
<li><em>Music</em>: I like it uses the screen real-estate better then the iPhone version
and it&rsquo;s much nicer to browse music on</li>
<li><em>Tweetbot</em>: Tweetbot for iPad is the best Twitter client for iPad hands down
(on the iPhone it&rsquo;s more contested) and sync with Tweetmarker makes it much
easier moving between iPhone and iPad versions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve learned I make pretty bad use of the dock on both devices.
<a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> or <a href="http://www.lastpass.com">Lastpass</a> should probably be in the dock on either device -
probably with a feed reader as a close run after that (Reeder or Mr. Reader).
These apps feature on either home screen as you can see from the screenshots
above. Food for thought I guess!</p></p>
