<p>In 2002, the British Film Institute depicted popcorn as &ldquo;the most profitable

the popcorn we eat costs less to produce than the very container it comes
in. -

<p>Further research indicates that isn&rsquo;t quite true - antimatter is the most
expensive substance in the world. But for a common, everyday item, it&rsquo;s very
expensive indeed. There&rsquo;s a lot less risk in production then Heroin and a lot
bigger market the Plutonium, for instance.<br /></p></p>

for Mac OS X as a desktop and how he used to feel guilty about it (given his very
impressive open source credentials).</p>
<p>I used to feel the same also. Android even as a platform more closely follows my
ideals, yet I am exclusively an avid iOS user at this point. But as I&rsquo;ve learned
more, the importance of pragmatism is clear. I use my personal iOS devices for
countless hours a day and I really just want them to work. I want them to work
in the way they were designed to do: quickly check email, browse the web, make
calls, check messages and so forth.</p></p>

                <p><p>I recently finished reading Steve Jobs, the biography by Walter Isaacson. I
can&rsquo;t add much more then the extensive coverage that it has recieved in the
press to date. Instead I paraphrase really badly a friend of mine, Noel Hudson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that book thought me was dropping acid and treating people really badly
works as a life strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While that&rsquo;s not entirely true it is a humourous look at the books tone. It has
a grain of truth, Walter Issacson really focuses on the warts and all
representation of Steve Jobs. He defines him very much in terms of how other
people percieved him, whether that should have been the mainstay of the book is
up for debate. Overall it&rsquo;s a good book, what I liked most is the history
lessons of the creation of the mac and how the Disney/Pixar relationship went
down before the merger. I also felt Walter Issacson left it hanging at the end
and that he knows much more that he can&rsquo;t publish due to Apple&rsquo;s corporate
strategy being tied to Jobs so much (like the comment he made about cracking the
UI for a TV).</p></p>

<h3 id="iphone-dock">iPhone dock</h3>
<img src="../../files/2012/07/iphone.png" alt="iPhone homescreen" />
<ul>
<li><em>Phone app</em>: pretty self explanatory</li>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Still the best mobile browser I think (though if Google ever gets
going on a proper Chrome browser for Android that may change)</li>
<li><em>Tweetbot</em>: I like Twitter the most of the social networks and tweetbot is the
Swiss army knife if twitter clients</li>
<li><em>Music</em> (aka. iPod app) : I use my iPhone in my car and sometimes at work to
listen to music</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ipad-dock">iPad dock</h3>
<img src="../../files/2012/07/ipad.png" alt="iPhone homescreen" />
<ul>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Safari on iPad is not as good as the iPhone version - it can be more
full featured I think!</li>
<li><em>Mail app</em>: E-mail on the iPad is one of the most popular uses, it&rsquo;s got just
the right amount of screen real-estate to do it justice</li>
<li><em>Photography folder</em>: I don&rsquo;t know why I mistook myself as being interested in
photography, but here&rsquo;s a folder I almost never use (bar camera app)</li>
<li><em>Music</em>: I like it uses the screen real-estate better then the iPhone version
and it&rsquo;s much nicer to browse music on</li>
<li><em>Tweetbot</em>: Tweetbot for iPad is the best Twitter client for iPad hands down
(on the iPhone it&rsquo;s more contested) and sync with Tweetmarker makes it much
easier moving between iPhone and iPad versions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve learned I make pretty bad use of the dock on both devices.
<a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> or <a href="http://www.lastpass.com">Lastpass</a> should probably be in the dock on either device -
probably with a feed reader as a close run after that (Reeder or Mr. Reader).
These apps feature on either home screen as you can see from the screenshots
above. Food for thought I guess!</p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s harder than you think. Right now you&rsquo;re probably underestimating the
amount of frustration and discomfort you&rsquo;re about to experience, without
realizing that by doing so you&rsquo;re creating all sorts of subtle barriers to
obtaining a deep understanding of programming.</p>

<h4 id="language-does-matter">Language does matter</h4>
<p>I find this part extremely true: my first language is Java. Every programming
language I&rsquo;ve tried since has been through comparing it to Java. I&rsquo;ve had
criticism of each different language based on my assumptions. Scripting
languages being prone to bad coding because they are not strictly typed, having
to do tedious work with languages that require memory management (my time is too
valuable!).</p></p>

a subscription to sites like
<a href="http://www.lynda.com" title="Lynda Training Videos">Lynda.com</a>. Between those and
Youtube, I&rsquo;ve watched an awful lot of technology how-to videos and 90% of them
are quite poor in terms of editing, sound and being coherent/properly scripted.
Sometimes though it&rsquo;s a joy to genuinely learn something new in a short, concise
and to the point video.</p>

<p>This haktip is right up there with being among the best: short, concise, to the
point and about a utility that will be super-useful to me. In work I&rsquo;m in an
agile software development team and I spend a lot of time on the command line. I
<strong>like</strong> the command line, but many don&rsquo;t (personal preference I guess). As part
of being agile, we produce a lot of video demos to stakeholders. Increasingly
though the demos we produce are just as useful for the team - you can&rsquo;t be every
team member at once and this provides huge visibility to the team of progress.
Our software is a Unix product, but we develop on Windows - so Camtasia is
usually used - which is fine for GUI demos. This handy utility will be great to
demo CLI stuff we do.</p></p>
