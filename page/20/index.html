Irish Blog Awards from what I can gather is a new event, hoping to happen in March 2007. They have an impressive list of backers, so I expect significant (although maybe minor) coverage in the media. Unfortunately they called it Duey Fensters, but I thank them for the link nonetheless! These are the categories that will be adjudicated on:</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>December 13, 2006</time>

I did a short video test, maybe this could be the start of my VideoBlogging career:
Well maybe not! But I do hope to have more videos on my blog! The video is of me describing my living quarters and about my laptop. I needed to be a bit closer to the phone as hearing me is difficult sometimes (not so in real life!</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>December 10, 2006</time>

But I believe, as I know there are probably many out their like me, that the Irish Domain Registry have taken this one step too far. One only has to look to Slashdot to see what the rest of the world thinks about our backwards, censorship-driven domain registry.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 19, 2006</time>

Looks like I have seen good advice from the Web, never buy a first generation Apple product, until they work out the kinks! I guess Mactivate have been snowed under with heatsink problems, that they never bothered to check other parts of my Macbook, since it is such a common problem.They have ordered me a new &ldquo;logic board&rdquo; (I am guessing the PMU like I thought it was ;-) ).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 3, 2006</time>

Mactivate have informed me they have one on order from Apple, so it will take a bit longer than I anticipated to get my Macbook back. I found this strange as I had not experienced random shutdowns like the ones that have been widely reported across the web. it was like I described in my earlier post, something to do with the battery not being able to charge.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>November 1, 2006</time>

One comment I read said it all really:
Seems even the IE team knows that IE is dead.
As for the ex-lax, bugs, pubes in the cake of course none of that is true. Those things would only be possible if someone at Microsoft actually made the cake, and that&rsquo;s not how MS does things.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 26, 2006</time>

He&rsquo;s at a fragile old age, so he can&rsquo;t read the screen all too well. This is not a problem however, as he sets all fonts to 16 and higher in Firefox (which is out of beta and into version 2.0!). That got me thinking, as I really struggled to read this page being marginally away from the screen, as I am a [Keratoconus][] sufferer.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>October 25, 2006</time>
