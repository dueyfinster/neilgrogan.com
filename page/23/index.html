                <p><p>One of the biggest complaints of Linux is that software doesn’t install to
well, or is very difficult to install. “Dependency Hell” (When software relies
on other bits of software to work), used to be quite commonplace. Ubuntu has
cleaned a lot of dependency hell up, and a new program for installing software
from the internet, is included in the new version, due to be released 1st June
2006.</p>
<p>That’s when I discovered a little gem called <a href="http://klik.atekon.de/" title="Klik it!">Klik</a> for many Linux
distributions. Simply lookup the piece of software you need, click on it and
you have it! No need to install! It places the whole program on the desktop,
so it is easily deletable and easily transferable. For example, if you have an
office application, and your friend doesn’t, simply copy that file on desktop
to your usb key or a cd, and copy to friends pc, done and dusted - Your friend
has the whole application! This is an obvious feature bonus over current
Windows version, XP.</p></p>

you have downloaded one? Like most users, even advanced PC users, they get
nervous about installing Linux and afraid of what they might have to learn.
Touted as the brighest star, Ubuntu really does outshine other Linuxes, with
usability, features and great range of software. Now you can try Ubuntu on
Windows.</p>

then, with Danish cartoons, Dublin Riots and a few policy changes to the site.
First of all the cartoons, I mean, whats all the fuss? Christianity is banned
in Saudi Arabia and Muslims in the middle east just don’t get the idea of
‘free press’. No one should be allowed to immigrate to the western world, if
they do not hold the core values which we hold, such as human rights, free of
expression/press and other values. Should we worry about the middle east? Not
at all, they’re behind the times, their loss. Why is it that movies which
parody Christianity are so popular with Christians (like Monty Python)? We
have evolved and can tolerate jokes and laugh at ourselves, many, but not all
Muslims have not learned to do this, but they will, its called evolution, and
sooner or later, it will hit the middle east. I am not defending the Cartoons,
and I know Muslims do not produce images of Muhammad, and offense to this, I
can understand. But they need to relax, maybe try some of the many drugs they
like to export to us?</p></p>

text book one you read about (Bavarian Trad Dress, Beer-drinking, Pretzel
Eating, Sausage loving etc!). Of course all of these elements were present,
but I think a modern German society closely reflects American one, in a lot of
ways. Germans are the largest group by ethnicity in United States, so maybe
its just German culture prevalent in America?</p></p>

tell you what I am looking forward to in 2006. The year was firmly in the
hands of mother nature as we saw in both Pakistan, New Orleans/Gulf of Mexico
and the Tsunami’s after effects. International consensus was reached at the G8
as London was being bombed - not by the IRA, but by their new enemies in the
middle east. Iran esculated its pressure on the world by resuming its nuclear
activities. George W. Bush took office in January, much to the distaste of the
Daily Mirror in the UK, who scored their most famous headline, “How Could
59,054,087 People, Be So Dumb?”.</p></p>
