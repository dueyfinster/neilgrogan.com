Here in Ireland, the two main broadcast methods of receiving TV are satellite (<a href=https://www.freesat.co.uk/>Freesat</a> / <a href=https://www.sky.com/ie/>Sky</a>) and terrestrial aerial (<a href=https://www.saorview.ie/>Saorview</a>).</p><p>An issue I have one larger sitting room TV and one small living room TV. I couldn&rsquo;t get both to be Samsung (out of stock on smallest sizes - which seem to be going out of fashion). So both TVs had very different methods of switching between satellite and aerial connections. I&rsquo;m not sure if it is a hardware limitation (they make switching tuners slow to hide this), a licensing issue (broadcasters pay to be on the <a href=https://www.freesat.co.uk/>Freesat</a> EPG for example) or a software issue (seems least likely). The fact multiple TV brands (in my case Phillips/Samsung) make it this clunky - makes me think it&rsquo;s a licensing issue. I wanted to solve this by using an external box and having one mental model for navigating broadcast TV.</p><p>As I was busy researching the parts I need to fix the satellite - I thought I would look to address the issue of having one set of channels with a 7 day programme guide for Saorview and Freesat. I came across a thread on <a href=https://www.boards.ie>Boards.ie</a> suggesting a Linux-based reciever box that is made in China: the Zgemma H7S. The specs on this reciever are good: 4K resolution, 2 Satellite Tuners and one terrestrial/cable tuner. Having two tuners of the same type is key here: it allows you to record and watch any channel at the same time. The operating system being Linux and that by nature being very easy to modify are a bonus ! Also you have a choice of which distribution you want to use (I got <a href=https://www.openvix.co.uk/>OpenViX</a> pre-installed on mine) which leads to lots of choices in plugins and skins (how you want it to look).</p><p>One excellent feature is the ability to stream from this box, and use <a href=https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif>OpenWebif</a> to configure the &ldquo;bouquets&rdquo; (groups of channels like News/Sport etc) or simply change the channels from your phone with the excellent <a href=https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/telly-mote/id813137455>tellymote</a>. It can grab the bouquets from <a href=https://www.sky.com/ie/>Sky</a>/<a href=https://www.freesat.co.uk/>Freesat</a> and the interface is very similar to Sky. It&rsquo;s definitely not as seamless - you need to configure some plugins to update the 7-day Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) for example and every so often channels do move and rename themselves (so you should edit them in OpenWebIf to change/remove them from EPG). But overall I&rsquo;m very happy with this solution!</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=../tags/linux>#linux</a>
