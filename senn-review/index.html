great product for Audiophiles. I have to say for someone who constantly
listens to a lot of music - good headphones like these are a must. They
are expensive for sure, but Sennheiser do seem to have a great durability
and solid build quality. This is my first set of such high quality headphones,
so bear that in mind - I can&rsquo;t speak for other manufacturers in this space.</p><p>The greatest and most valuable aspect is the wear time of these headphones. Any
other cheap headphones I&rsquo;ve bought, I&rsquo;d always feel after 20-30 minutes my
ears would be burning. It&rsquo;s easy to forget these long periods of wear until
you have a very long Skype call. You start to wish the call was over to rest
your poor ears! The selling point of this particular model is that they are
faithful to the sound that&rsquo;s meant to be heard. Surely that&rsquo;s what you want to hear?
For some people that&rsquo;s not the case and you&rsquo;ll find them buying Dr. Dre or
Skullcandies finest set of headphones and to be honest more power to them! But
for myself, I want faithful reproduction and not headphones targeted at a
certain genre - HD595&rsquo;s prove a good fit.</p><p><a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4777334194_0bba662131.jpg title="An Example of Sennheiser Headphones. (Photo credit: gcg2009)"><img src=../files/2011/03/senn.jpg class=left alt="Sennheiser Headphones"></a></p><p>To compensate for the lack of targeting of genres, I&rsquo;ve found it necessary to use
an equalizer once or twice - but mainly to satisfy my need for bass or drum cymbals
and reinforce the beat of a song that&rsquo;s probably on too loud for my own good anyway.
Normal people shouldn&rsquo;t be this fussy, but then again most people don&rsquo;t spend this
amount of coin on headphones (as one work colleague remarked to me: Your mad! - after
hearing the cost, he liked the &lsquo;phones though). The benchmark song I usually use is the
Robert Miles classic &ldquo;Children&rdquo;. I think if you can hear all the fine intricacies of
that song, your getting fairly good sound reproduction, in my humble opinion.</p><p>In the end all I really wanted was a portable alternative to my Creative 7.1 surround
sound system (which I reviewed here a few years back) but having said that I was under
no illusion headphones could replace a very-powerful, room oriented acoustics. HD595&rsquo;s
do the best job I could have ask of them - but one major gripe is the are not portable
music player friendly. Why? 6.3mm as the default jack with a clumsy 6.3 to 3.5mm jack
and the extremely long cord included in the pack. It&rsquo;s great to dock at a desk and with
the included dock adaptor it&rsquo;s more clearly aimed at this type of market. Or maybe Guitar
players with the jack size? I imagine it&rsquo;s probably good for electric guitar players, but
I wouldn&rsquo;t know being allergic to instruments unfortunately. The openear design (it has
holes to allow sound escape at the side of your ears) certainly improves listening, but
will annoy anyone near enough to hear it, so <em>please</em> forget these for commuting!! Overall
a great buy if you plan to use them as much as I have and will.</p></div></div><a href=https://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-size=small data-count=none>Tweet</a>
