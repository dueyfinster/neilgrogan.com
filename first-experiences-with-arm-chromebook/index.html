<h1 class="post-title">First Experiences with an ARM Chromebook</h1>
    
    <time>December 8, 2012</time>
    

    <div>
        
        <p>
        <p>I  recently bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=duefinsblo-20">Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch)</a>. I am fascinated by living tied to the web, indeed my honours computer science thesis deals with this in relation to mobile applications (and hybrid half-app/ half-website). Spurred on by the excellent reviews this Chromebook has gotten (&quot;<i>It&rsquo;s $1,000 worth of design made with $100 worth of materials</i>&quot; - <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/24/3549368/samsung-chromebook-review-series-3">The Verge</a> and &ldquo;<i>You simply won&rsquo;t find a netbook this nice for that little money.</i>&rdquo; - <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/07/samsung-chromebook-review-2012/">Engadget</a>).<br /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m typing this review on the laptop now and it&rsquo;s keyboard is the first thing that is noticeably good. As good as my MacBook Pro that cost <b>10x</b> as much (bar the lack of a back-light which I miss). The design is clearly inspired by the Macbook Air - it is light and very portable. Battery life is also good, 6.5-7 hours in most reviews. Also it&rsquo;s fan-less and I have been unable to make it get hot (unlike almost every other laptop I have owned). I&rsquo;m a heavy Google user (been using Docs since 2007, Calendar since 2006 and Gmail since 2004) so the promise of the apps I use most being on the Chromebook was a non-issue. I&rsquo;m also a very lackadaisical gamer, I&rsquo;ll happily go a long time without a proper console/pc game and fill the void with 5 minutes of cut the rope or Angry Birds (and these are better on my smartphone then in Chrome).</p>
<p>I also use a lot of web services. I&rsquo;ve gone out of my way to put files on Google Drive when I knew I was buying this machine. I&rsquo;ve already used Picasa for years and uploaded my music to Google Music recently. I use Evernote for notes (their web version is flaky offline though, hopefully this will be fixed). I&rsquo;m trying my best to stick to this laptop for all personal use. My work laptop is a Windows machine, but I spend almost all of my time in a Linux remote desktop and in Chrome. That brings me to one thing I miss and that is a proper IDE. I&rsquo;ve researched the web versions and frankly they are pretty bad. I do see promise though - having it all managed would be a great asset - I&rsquo;ve seen countless people struggle with IDE issues.</p>
<p>My struggle with this laptop is where it fits (between desktop, power laptop, smartphone, tablet etc). For the first time a generation who could almost entirely survive on touch interfaces is growing up - so it&rsquo;s no wonder Microsoft is positioning the Surface for the office of the future - people will expect, nay demand some sort of touch. The issue is whether ChromeOS (which almost certainly will merge the divide and bring out a touch laptop) can win this space with just web apps. This has almost made me feel old in technology terms. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - I love touch. But I also love my keyboard for coding, you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_my_cold,_dead_hands">pry it from my cold dead hands</a>. I&rsquo;m also not getting rid of my MacBook Pro, I still need that safety cushion of proper computer. I feel the same way about my desktop - I like sitting down at a computer and experiencing comfort!</p>
<p>But I realise I own too many devices. I like cloud computing because it  also means I can have low-powered, cheap devices and not have to worry about backup. ChromeOS extends this so the laptop updates automatically every six weeks. So how can I trim the fat? I&rsquo;m not sure&hellip; I&rsquo;ll report back with more findings from sticking to just ChromeOS in a later post - stay tuned!</p>
