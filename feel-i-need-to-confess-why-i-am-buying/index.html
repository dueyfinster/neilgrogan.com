my <a href=http://www.opensource.org/ title="Open Source">Open Source</a>/<a href=http://www.fsf.org/ title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software</a> ways? No, definately 100% NOT. I’ll
explain why: I think Apple Computer has an incredible product in Mac OSx. For
anyone who has not used it before, pop into a 3G store and ask to have a go.
When someone releases a good a product as that, they deserve money, in my
opinion. Under “the” free software license (<a href=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt title="GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a>) it
is permissable for anyone to charge for software licensed under it, as long as
an offer of source code is given (for 3 years afterwards). Deep down I love
<a href=http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ title="Ubuntu Linux">Ubuntu</a>, and I will install it as soon as possible when they release a
version for the Intel powered Apple computers. In fact I will use my Laptop to
showcase Ubuntu you had of told me November last year I’d spend well over
€1,000 on an <a href=http://www.apple.com/ title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>, I would have told you that I hated Apple, and
would never consider it! What has changed my mind? I got a iPod Nano for
Christmas ‘05 and thought it was great, but the Nano on its own still wouldn’t
convince me to get a Mac.</p><p>I was always going to buy a laptop this year, but the turning point was me
using Mac OSX on a computer in work, that sold it itself. Don’t get me wrong,
I still despise Apple for their copy protection (why can’t I play songs I
bought on non-Apple mp3 players? Its Anti- competitive!) on songs bought on
<a href=http://www.apple.com/itunes/ title=iTunes>iTunes</a>, but I feel this was <a href=http://www.riaa.com/ title="Record Industry Association of America is Evil">forced by the record companies</a>, it just had a nice side affect for Apple to lock people to
<a href=http://www.apple.com/ipod/ title="Apple iPod">iPods</a>. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X title="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a> <a href=http://www.opendarwin.org/ title="Open Darwin">is built on top of Open Source</a>, partly the
reason for it being so good! So in reality, instead of me paying for lets say
RedHat, Suse or Linspire (all Linux) with proprietary drivers and an open
source kernel, I am buying into Mac OS X which also has an open source kernel,
but with more proprietary applications. Also I have Ubuntu on my two desktops,
my <a href=http://europe.nokia.com/770 title="Nokia 770">Nokia 770</a> runs <a href=http://www.kernel.org/ title="Linux Kernel">Linux</a> and I do not use Windows whatsoever. So I am
still as big of a Free and Open Source FanBoi as I ever was, perhaps even
more, hey your talking to a guy who plays <a href=http://www.vorbis.com/ title="Ogg Vorbis is a completely open, patent-free, professional audio encoding and streaming technology with all the benefits of Open Source.">Ogg Vorbis</a> on his <a href=http://www.rockbox.org/ title="Rockbox Open Source iPod Firmware">rockboxed</a>
